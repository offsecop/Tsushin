## 1. Getting Started

Welcome to Tsushin -- your multi-tenant AI agent platform. This section walks you through going from zero to your first AI conversation.

### For Administrators: Installer Options (v0.6.0)

If you're the administrator installing Tsushin for your organization, run `python3 install.py` from the repository root. v0.6.0 adds three installer behaviors worth knowing about:

- **`--le-staging`** -- when combined with `--domain` and `--email`, uses the Let's Encrypt **staging** directory instead of production. Use this to rehearse the full ACME flow without burning your production rate-limit budget (LE limits you to ~5 failed challenges per domain per hour on production). Example: `python3 install.py --defaults --domain app.example.com --email you@example.com --le-staging`.
- **IP-address installs now work correctly.** The self-signed SAN now emits `IP:<addr>,DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1,IP:::1` (the old format `DNS:<IP>` was rejected by browsers and curl). If you're accessing Tsushin by IP (e.g., `https://10.0.0.5`), the installer detects a stale SAN from a prior run and regenerates automatically.
- **Frontend rebuild on API URL change.** If you rerun the installer and change `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, the installer diffs the previous `.env` and rebuilds the frontend image with `--no-cache`. Previously it would silently ship a stale cached bundle and leave the UI pointing at the old URL.

Full installer reference, GKE/Helm, GCP Secret Manager, and `.env` details live in [documentation.md §3 Quick Start](documentation.md#3-quick-start) and [§4 Deployment & Operations](documentation.md#4-deployment--operations).

### First Login and Setup Wizard

When you open Tsushin for the first time, you will be greeted by the **Setup Wizard**. This one-time process creates your organization and your administrator account.

1. Open your Tsushin URL in a browser (for example, `https://localhost` or the URL provided by your administrator).
2. You will be redirected to the `/setup` page automatically.
3. Fill in your **name**, **email address**, and **password** to create your admin account.
4. Enter your **organization name** -- this becomes your tenant in the system.
5. Click **Complete Setup**. You are now logged in as the organization owner.

During setup, Tsushin automatically creates provider instances for any supported API keys you enter and assigns the selected primary provider as the initial **System AI**. The completion screen also reveals an auto-generated **global admin** email/password pair for system-level administration, so make sure to capture it before you leave the page.

After first login, an 8-step onboarding tour highlights Watcher, Studio, Hub, Channels, Flows, Playground, Security, and the final setup checklist.

### Creating Your Organization

Your organization (also called a "tenant") is your isolated workspace. Everything you create -- agents, flows, knowledge bases, integrations -- lives inside it. The setup wizard creates it for you, but you can customize it later:

1. Go to **Settings** (gear icon in the sidebar).
2. Click **Organization**.
3. Here you can update your organization name, view your plan and usage limits, and see current-month usage statistics.
4. Click **Save Changes** when done.

### Setting Up Your First AI Provider

Before your agents can think and respond, you need to connect at least one AI provider (such as OpenAI, Google Gemini, or Anthropic Claude).

1. Navigate to **Hub** in the sidebar.
2. Click on the **Providers** section.
3. Click **Add Provider** and choose your provider type. Supported providers include:
   - **OpenAI** (GPT-4o, GPT-4, GPT-3.5, etc.)
   - **Anthropic** (Claude 4 Opus, Claude 4 Sonnet, etc.)
   - **Google Gemini**
   - **Groq** (fast inference)
   - **Grok** (xAI)
   - **DeepSeek**
   - **Ollama** (local/self-hosted models)
   - **OpenRouter** (multi-provider router)
   - **Vertex AI** (Google Cloud)
   - **Custom** (any OpenAI-compatible endpoint)
4. Give the provider instance a **name** (e.g., "My OpenAI Account").
5. Paste your **API key**.
6. Optionally set a **base URL** if you are using a custom endpoint.
7. Select a **default model** from the list (models are auto-discovered from the provider).
8. Click **Save**.

### Creating Your First Agent

1. Go to **Studio > Agents** in the sidebar.
2. Click **Create New Agent**.
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Agent Name** -- give it a friendly name (e.g., "Customer Support Bot").
   - **System Prompt** -- write instructions that define how the agent should behave.
   - **Model Provider** -- select the provider you just configured.
   - **Model Name** -- pick the specific model.
   - Optionally assign a **Persona** for a pre-built personality and tone.
4. Click **Create**.

### Testing in the Playground

1. Go to **Playground** in the sidebar.
2. Select your newly created agent from the agent dropdown at the top.
3. Type a message and press Enter.
4. The agent will respond using the provider and model you configured.

## 2. LLM Providers and Hub

### Configuring AI Providers

Tsushin supports a wide range of AI providers. You can connect as many as you need, and each agent can use a different one.

| Provider | Description |
|---|---|
| OpenAI | GPT-4o, GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and other OpenAI models |
| Anthropic | Claude 4 Opus, Claude 4 Sonnet, Claude Haiku |
| Gemini | Google's Generative AI models |
| Groq | Ultra-fast inference for open models |
| Grok | xAI's models |
| DeepSeek | DeepSeek's reasoning and coding models |
| Ollama | Run open-source models locally on your own hardware |
| OpenRouter | A multi-provider router -- access many models through one API |
| Vertex AI | Google Cloud's enterprise AI platform |
| Custom (OpenAI-compatible) | Any service that speaks the OpenAI API format |

**Adding a Provider Instance:**

1. Go to **Hub > Providers**.
2. Click **Add Provider**.
3. Fill in: **Name**, **Type**, **API Key**, optionally **Base URL**, and **Default Model**.
4. Click **Save**.

You can have multiple instances of the same provider type (e.g., two different OpenAI accounts for different teams).

**Model Discovery and Pricing:**

When you add a provider, Tsushin automatically queries its API to discover available models. To configure cost tracking, go to **Settings > Model Pricing** to set per-model input and output costs (per 1M tokens). These costs appear in the Watcher billing dashboard.

**Anthropic prompt caching (v0.6.0):**

Anthropic requests are automatically **prompt-cached** — Claude caches the stable prefix of each conversation (system prompt, persona, skill catalog, knowledge snippets) and reuses it on subsequent turns. For chat-heavy workloads this typically cuts input token cost by **40–65%** with no configuration required on your end. Cache hits show up in the Playground debug panel as `cache_read_input_tokens`. The default Anthropic model in v0.6.0 is `claude-haiku-4-5` — you can override per-agent in the agent config. Technical details: [documentation.md §19.6](documentation.md#196-anthropic-prompt-caching--v060).

### Hub Integrations

The Hub is your integration marketplace. Beyond AI providers, you can connect external services.

#### Google (Calendar and Gmail)

1. Go to **Settings > Integrations** and enter your Google OAuth Client ID and Client Secret.
2. Go to **Hub > Integrations**, find Google Calendar or Gmail, and click **Connect**.
3. Sign in with your Google account and grant permissions.
4. Enable the **Calendar** or **Gmail** skill on your agents.

#### Asana

1. Go to **Hub > Integrations**, find Asana, and click **Connect**.
2. Authorize via OAuth. Agents with the appropriate skills can list projects, create tasks, and query your workspace.

#### Browser Automation

Two modes: **Playwright** (in-container, no setup needed) or **CDP** (connects to your host Chrome). Configure under **Hub > Integrations**.

#### TTS Providers (Text-to-Speech)

Three options: **Kokoro** (local, self-hosted), **OpenAI TTS**, or **ElevenLabs**. Configure under **Hub > TTS Providers**, then enable the TTS skill on your agents.

#### MCP Server Registration

Connect external MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool servers under **Hub > MCP Servers**. Choose SSE (HTTP) or Stdio (local command-line) transport.

## 3. Creating and Configuring Agents

Agents are the AI assistants that power your conversations across every channel.

### Agent Form Fields

| Field | Required? | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| **Agent Name** | Yes | The display name your users will see. |
| **System Prompt** | Yes | Core instructions. Use `{{PERSONA}}` and `{{TONE}}` placeholders for dynamic injection. |
| **Description** | No | A short summary of what this agent does. |
| **Persona** | No | Select a pre-built or custom persona (see Section 4). |
| **Tone Preset / Custom Tone** | No | Choose a tone preset or write custom tone instructions. |
| **Model Provider** | Yes | The AI provider to use. |
| **Model Name** | Yes | The specific model from that provider. |
| **Trigger Keywords** | No | Words that activate this agent in group chats (e.g., "help", "support"). |
| **Avatar** | No | Choose an avatar style (samurai, robot, ninja, etc.). |
| **Active** | -- | Enabled by default. Uncheck to deactivate without deleting. |
| **Default** | -- | Mark as the default agent for new conversations. |

After creating the agent, open it to access six tabs: **Configuration**, **Channels**, **Memory Management**, **Skills**, **Knowledge Base**, and **Shared Knowledge**.

### Channel Configuration

On the **Channels** tab:
1. **Enable channels** -- toggle which channels the agent is available on: Playground, WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Webhook.
2. **Assign integrations** -- for each enabled channel, select the specific integration instance.

### Memory Configuration

On the **Memory Management** tab:

| Setting | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Memory Isolation Mode** | `Isolated` (per-user, default), `Shared` (all users share), or `Channel Isolated` (per-channel). |
| **Memory Size** | Recent messages kept in working memory. Leave blank for system default. |
| **Semantic Search** | Enable meaning-based recall of older conversations (default: on). |
| **Semantic Search Results** | Max past memories retrieved per query (default: 10). |
| **Similarity Threshold** | Minimum match score for retrieval (0.0-1.0; default: 0.5). |
| **Temporal Decay** | Older memories gradually lose importance (default: off). |
| **Decay Rate** | Speed of memory fading (default: 0.01 = ~69-day half-life). |
| **MMR Diversity Weight** | Balances relevance vs. diversity (0-1; default: 0.5). |

### Trigger Overrides

Per-agent settings that override your tenant's global defaults. Leave blank to inherit the default.

| Setting | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **DM Auto-Response** | Enable/disable auto-response to direct messages from unknown senders. |
| **Group Filters** | Restrict which groups this agent monitors (e.g., `["Support Group", "VIP Chat"]`). |
| **Number Filters** | Restrict which phone numbers this agent responds to. |
| **Context Message Count** | How many recent group messages the agent reads for context. |
| **Context Character Limit** | Maximum character length of the context window. |

### Cloning Agents

Use the **Clone** action on the Agents list to duplicate an agent with all configuration -- system prompt, persona, skills, memory settings, and channel bindings.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

Two built-in skills for agents to work together:

- **Agent Switcher** -- lets users switch their default agent via natural language (e.g., "Switch me to the Support agent"). **Default execution mode in v0.6.0 is `hybrid`** — both the keyword trigger ("Switch me to ...") and the LLM tool call work, so deterministic phrasings never miss and the LLM can also route on intent.
- **Agent Communication (A2A)** -- allows agents to ask other agents questions, discover agents, or delegate tasks.

Manage inter-agent messaging from **Studio > Agent Communication**.

---

## 4. Personas and Tone Presets

Personas and tone presets define reusable personality templates shared across multiple agents.

### Creating a Persona

Navigate to **Studio > Personas** and click **Create Persona**:

| Field | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Unique name within your tenant. |
| **Description** | Summary of what this persona represents. |
| **Role** | Job title or function (e.g., "Customer Support Specialist"). |
| **Role Description** | Detailed responsibilities and context. |
| **Personality Traits** | Comma-separated traits (e.g., "Empathetic, patient, enthusiastic"). |
| **Tone Preset / Custom Tone** | Assign a preset or write custom tone description. |
| **Guardrails** | Safety rules and constraints (e.g., "Never provide medical advice"). |

### Tone Presets

- **Tone Preset** -- select from the built-in library (Friendly, Professional, Humorous, etc.).
- **Custom Tone** -- write your own free-text tone description.

### System vs. Custom Personas

**System personas** are built-in templates (read-only names, but clonable). **Custom personas** are yours to create and fully edit.

---

## 6. Setting Up Communication Channels

Tsushin supports six communication channels. Each connects your AI agents to the messaging platforms your users already use.

### WhatsApp

1. Go to **Hub > Channels > WhatsApp** and click **Add Instance**.
2. Enter a name and the WhatsApp phone number.
3. **Scan the QR code** -- open WhatsApp on your phone, go to **Settings > Linked Devices > Link a Device**, and scan the QR displayed in Tsushin. It expires after ~60 seconds; refresh if needed.
4. Once scanned, the instance status changes to **Running** with a green "Connected" indicator.

**Configure filters:**
- **Group Filters** -- which WhatsApp groups the bot monitors (e.g., "Support Group", "VIP Chat").
- **Number Filters** -- restrict the bot to specific phone numbers.
- **Group Keywords** -- the bot only responds to group messages containing these keywords (e.g., "help", "bot").
- **DM Auto-Mode** (enabled by default) -- auto-reply to DMs from unknown senders. Disable to only respond to pre-registered contacts.
- **Conversation Delay** -- adds a pause before replying (default: 5 seconds) for a more human feel.

**Assign to an agent:** On the agent's **Channels** tab, set **WhatsApp Integration** to this instance.

**Upgrading from 0.5.x — WhatsApp LID migration (v0.6.0):**

WhatsApp is rolling out **Linked Device IDs (LIDs)** — a new privacy-aware identifier that replaces the phone-number JID for many participants (especially in groups). v0.6.0 handles this transparently:

- Existing contacts keep working -- the adapter auto-links new LIDs to existing contacts by phone number on first message.
- Per-contact default agents (`UserAgentSession`) and slash-command permissions (`ContactAgentMapping`) accept either LID or phone-number keys.
- If a group member appears as a new contact after the upgrade (because WhatsApp now exposes only their LID), open the contact's edit modal and add the previous phone number as an alternate identifier to re-link them.

No migration script is needed. Full details: [documentation.md §15.1.1](documentation.md#1511-migration-lid-support-v060).

### Telegram

1. Create a bot via **@BotFather** on Telegram (`/newbot`), copy the bot token.
2. Go to **Hub > Channels > Telegram**, click **Add Bot**, paste the token.
3. Choose **Polling** (simpler, no public URL needed) or **Webhook** (recommended for production, requires HTTPS URL).
4. Assign to an agent on the **Channels** tab.

### Slack

1. **Create a Slack App** at [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps):
   - Bot token scopes: `chat:write`, `channels:read`, `users:read`, `files:write`.
   - For Socket Mode: enable it and generate an app-level token (`xapp-...`).
   - For HTTP Events API: set the Request URL and copy the Signing Secret.
2. Install the app to your workspace, copy the `xoxb-` bot token.
3. Go to **Hub > Channels > Slack**, click **Add Integration**, paste tokens.
4. Choose mode: **Socket Mode** (recommended) or **HTTP Events API**.
5. Set **DM Policy**: `Open` (accept all DMs), `Allowlist` (only allowed channels), or `Disabled`.
6. If using Allowlist, add Slack channel IDs to **Allowed Channels**.
7. Assign to an agent on the **Channels** tab.

### Discord

1. **Create a Discord Application** at [discord.com/developers](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Under **Bot**: copy the bot token, enable **Message Content Intent**.
3. Under **OAuth2 > URL Generator**: select `bot` scope + permissions (`Send Messages`, `Read Message History`, `Attach Files`). Use the URL to invite the bot to your server.
4. Go to **Hub > Channels > Discord**, click **Add Integration**, paste token and Application ID.
5. Set **DM Policy**: `Open`, `Allowlist`, or `Disabled`.
6. Add **Allowed Guilds** (server IDs) and optionally configure **Guild Channel Config** for per-guild channel restrictions.
7. Assign to an agent on the **Channels** tab.

### Webhook

1. Go to **Hub > Channels > Webhooks**, click **Add Integration**.
2. Enter a name and optionally a **Callback URL** for outbound responses.
3. Copy the generated **HMAC signing secret** (shown only once).
4. Optionally configure: **IP Allowlist** (CIDR ranges), **Rate Limit** (RPM), **Max Payload Size**.
5. Assign to an agent on the **Channels** tab.

**Testing with curl:**

```bash
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%s)
BODY='{"text":"Hello from webhook","sender_key":"external-user-1"}'
SECRET="your_api_secret_here"
SIGNATURE=$(echo -n "${TIMESTAMP}.${BODY}" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "${SECRET}" | awk '{print $2}')

curl -X POST http://your-tsushin-server/api/webhooks/<webhook_id>/inbound \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Tsushin-Signature: sha256=${SIGNATURE}" \
  -H "X-Tsushin-Timestamp: ${TIMESTAMP}" \
  -d "${BODY}"
```

### Playground

The built-in web chat interface. No setup required -- always available in the sidebar. See [Section 8](#8-using-the-playground) for details.

---

## 7. Managing Contacts

Contacts represent the people who interact with your agents across any channel.

### Creating a Contact

1. Go to **Agents > Contacts** and click **Add Contact**.
2. Fill in:
   - **Friendly Name** (required) -- must be unique within your tenant.
   - **Role** -- `User` (default), `Agent`, or `External`.
   - **Notes** -- optional free-text.
3. Click **Save**.

### Adding Channel Mappings

A single contact can be reachable on multiple channels:

1. Open the contact's detail page.
2. Under **Channel Mappings**, click **Add Mapping**.
3. Select the channel type and enter the identifier:
   - **WhatsApp** -- phone number (e.g., `+5511999990001`)
   - **Telegram** -- user ID (numeric)
   - **Discord** -- user ID (numeric snowflake)
   - **Email** -- email address

When that person messages from any mapped platform, Tsushin recognizes them as the same contact.

### DM Trigger Control

The **DM Trigger** toggle (enabled by default) controls whether incoming DMs from this contact trigger agent processing. Disable to receive and store messages without automated replies.

### Slash Command Access Control

Two levels:
- **Tenant Default** -- set in tenant settings, applies to all contacts.
- **Per-Contact Override** -- `Use tenant default` (null), `Enabled`, or `Disabled`.

### Linking Contacts to System User Accounts

Link a contact to a Tsushin user account under **Linked User**. Messages from that contact then inherit the user's RBAC permissions and appear in the audit trail under that user's identity.

### Assigning a Default Agent

Override the tenant's default routing: set a specific **Default Agent** for a contact so all their messages go to that agent regardless of channel.

---

## 8. Using the Playground

The Playground is Tsushin's built-in web chat interface for testing and interacting with your agents.

### Starting a Conversation

1. Click **Playground** in the sidebar.
2. Select an agent from the dropdown.
3. Type your message and press **Enter**.
4. The agent's response streams in real time.

### Thread Management

- **New Thread** -- click "+" to start a fresh conversation.
- **Switch Threads** -- click any thread in the sidebar.
- **Auto-Rename** -- threads are automatically named based on conversation content.

### Audio Recording and Transcription

If the **Audio Transcript** skill is enabled:
1. Click the **microphone** icon.
2. Speak your message.
3. Click again to stop -- the audio is transcribed and processed automatically.

### Document Uploads

Click the **upload** icon to attach files. Supported: `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.docx`.

### Command Palette

Type `/` in the message input to open the command palette -- browse and execute slash commands.

### Memory Inspector

Toggle from the toolbar to see what the agent "remembers" about the conversation and which memory entries influenced the response.

### Expert Mode

Toggle from the toolbar for advanced controls and diagnostics.

### WebSocket Streaming

Responses stream token-by-token via WebSocket by default. Falls back to HTTP polling if WebSocket is unavailable. No configuration needed.

---

## 9. Flows (Workflow Automation)

## 11. Projects (Knowledge Isolation)

Projects are tenant-wide workspaces with dedicated knowledge bases, memory settings, and tool configurations.

### Creating a Project

1. Navigate to **Studio > Projects** and click **Create Project**.
2. Fill in: **Name**, **Description**, **Icon**, **Color**, **Default Agent**, and optionally a **System Prompt Override**.

### Knowledge Base Configuration

Each project has its own settings: **Chunk Size** (default: 500), **Chunk Overlap** (default: 50), and **Embedding Model** (default: all-MiniLM-L6-v2).

### Memory Configuration

Per-project: **Semantic Memory** (on/off), **Results** (default: 10), **Similarity Threshold** (default: 0.5), **Factual Memory** (on/off), **Extraction Threshold** (default: 5 messages).

### Project Context via Slash Commands

```
/project enter MyProject     -- Enter project context
/project exit                -- Leave current project
/project list                -- List all projects
/project info                -- Show current project details
```

## 12. Memory and Knowledge

### Four Memory Layers

1. **Working Memory** -- the last N messages from each conversation (short-term context).
2. **Episodic Memory** -- all conversations indexed for semantic search (long-term recall).
3. **Semantic Knowledge** -- automatically extracted facts about users (preferences, roles, history).
4. **Shared Memory** -- cross-agent knowledge pool. If Agent A learns something, Agent B can access it.

### Uploading Knowledge Base Documents

Supported formats: `.txt`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.pdf`, `.docx`. Max: 50 MB per file.

1. Open the agent's **Knowledge Base** tab.
2. Click **Upload Document** and select your file.
3. The document is processed in the background (chunked and indexed).

### OKG (Ontology Knowledge Graph)

Structured memory that stores facts with relationships. Memory types: `fact`, `episodic`, `semantic`, `procedural`, `belief`.

Includes **MemGuard** security validation to protect against memory poisoning.

### Configuring Vector Stores

Go to **Settings > Vector Stores**:

- **Chroma** (default) -- built-in, no external setup.
- **Pinecone** -- cloud-hosted. Requires API key and index name.
- **Qdrant** -- self-hosted or cloud. Requires URL and collection name.
- **MongoDB Atlas** -- requires connection string and Atlas Vector Search.

Individual agents can override the default with three modes: **Override**, **Complement**, or **Shadow**.

## 13. Security -- Sentinel

Sentinel is Tsushin's AI-powered security system that monitors all agent interactions in real time.

### 8 Detection Types

1. **Prompt Injection** -- hidden commands trying to override agent instructions.
2. **Agent Takeover** -- attempts to hijack the agent's behavior entirely.
3. **Poisoning Attack** -- feeding false information to corrupt responses.
4. **Malicious Shell Intent** -- dangerous commands when agents have shell access.
5. **Memory Poisoning** -- injecting false facts into long-term memory. MemGuard validates every fact before storage.
6. **Agent Privilege Escalation** -- making an agent exceed its authorized permissions.
7. **Browser SSRF** -- forcing browser automation to access internal/restricted resources.
8. **Vector Store Poisoning** -- corrupting the vector database powering agent memory.

### Security Profiles

| Profile | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Off** | No security analysis (development only) |
| **Permissive** | Detect and log silently (no blocking) |
| **Moderate** | Block confirmed threats (recommended) |
| **Aggressive** | Maximum sensitivity, blocks borderline cases |

Assign profiles to agents on the agent's security settings. Create custom profiles by cloning an existing one.

### Viewing Security Events

Go to **Watcher > Security** tab to see blocked threats, warnings, and detections. Filter by severity, type, or date range.

### Exceptions and Allowlists

Go to **Settings > Sentinel Security > Exceptions** to add pattern-based, domain-based, or other exceptions to prevent false positives.

## 16. Using the Public API

Tsushin provides a REST API for programmatic access.

### Authentication

**Option 1: API Key** -- include as a header:
```
X-API-Key: your_client_secret_here
```

**Option 2: OAuth2 Client Credentials** -- exchange credentials for a bearer token:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-tsushin-url/api/v1/oauth/token \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=<your-client-id>&client_secret=<your-client-secret>"
```

Create API clients under **Settings > API Clients**.

### Quick Start

```bash
# List agents
curl -H "X-API-Key: <your-api-key>" https://your-tsushin-url/api/v1/agents

# Chat with an agent
curl -X POST -H "X-API-Key: <your-api-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  https://your-tsushin-url/api/v1/agents/1/chat \
  -d '{"message": "Hello! What can you help me with?"}'
```

### Key Endpoints

| Area | Endpoints | What You Can Do |
|---|---|---|
| **Agents** | `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/agents` | Manage agents, skills, personas |
| **Chat** | `POST /api/v1/agents/{id}/chat` | Send messages (sync or async) |
| **Threads** | `GET /api/v1/agents/{id}/threads` | Manage conversation threads |
| **Flows** | `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/flows` | Manage and execute workflows |
| **Skills** | `GET /api/v1/skills` | List available skills |

## 17. Audit and Compliance

### Viewing Audit Logs

Go to **Settings > Audit Logs** to browse events chronologically. Each shows timestamp, action type, user, severity, channel, and description. Click for full details.

### Filtering

Filter by **Action** (Authentication, Agents, Flows, etc.), **Severity** (Info, Warning, Critical), **Channel** (Web, API, WhatsApp, Telegram, System), and **Date Range**.

### CSV Export

Click **Export CSV** to download filtered events for external analysis or compliance reporting.

### Retention

Default: 90 days. Configure in the Audit Logs page. Events older than the retention window are automatically purged.

### Syslog Forwarding

Stream events to an external syslog collector:

1. On the Audit Logs page, scroll to **Syslog Forwarding**.
2. Configure: **Host**, **Port**, **Protocol** (UDP/TCP/TLS), **Facility**, **App Name** (default: "tsushin").
3. For TLS: paste your CA Certificate (PEM format).
4. Select which event categories to forward.
5. Save.

Events are formatted using the RFC 5424 syslog standard and delivered asynchronously.

## 18. Remote Access (System Administrators)

> **Audience:** Global Admins only. Regular tenant owners and members do not see this feature.

v0.6.0 introduces **Remote Access via Cloudflare Tunnel** — a one-click way to expose your Tsushin instance on a public HTTPS URL without opening firewall ports or managing a reverse proxy. It is **off by default** at both the system level and the per-tenant level, so nothing becomes internet-reachable until you explicitly enable it.

**Why you might use this:**
- Collaborate with external teams, testers, or auditors without VPN provisioning.
- Give Slack, Discord, or Webhook channels a stable HTTPS callback URL when running Tsushin on a laptop or a private network.
- Expose a short-lived demo environment.

**Two modes:**

| Mode | URL style | Lifetime | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Quick** | `https://<random>.trycloudflare.com` | Lives only while cloudflared is running; new URL each start | Dev, demos, short tests |
| **Named** | Custom FQDN you own (e.g., `https://tsushin.acme.com`) | Stable across restarts, bound to your Cloudflare Zero Trust account | Production, enterprise |

**Setting it up:**

1. Log in as a **Global Admin** and navigate to **System Administration > Remote Access** (`/system/remote-access`).
2. For **Quick Mode**: just click **Start**. Cloudflare hands you a throwaway HTTPS URL within a few seconds.
3. For **Named Mode**: create a tunnel in your Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard, copy the connector token, paste it into the Remote Access config, then **Start**.
4. **Enable per-tenant entitlement:** toggle Remote Access for each tenant you want to let in. Users from tenants that are not entitled see a login banner (*"Remote access is not enabled for this tenant"*) and a 403 is written to their tenant audit log as `auth.remote_access.denied`.

**Security posture:**

Cloudflare Tunnel makes the entire Tsushin app reachable on one public URL, so authentication and tenant entitlement become the sole gate. v0.6.0 has tightened which routes are anonymous (health, webhook receive, login) versus authenticated (everything else). Under Named Mode you can stack additional Zero Trust Access policies on top if you need them.

**Disabling remote access instantly:** `/system/remote-access` > **Tunnel Status** > **Stop**. The tunnel subprocess exits and no new requests can reach the instance from the public URL until you start it again.
