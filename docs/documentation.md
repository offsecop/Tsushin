## 2. Architecture Overview

### 2.1 Container topology (Docker Compose)

Tsushin ships as a Docker Compose stack defined in `docker-compose.yml`. The core services:

| Service | Image / Build | Port | Purpose | Source |
|---------|---------------|------|---------|--------|
| `tsushin-postgres` | `postgres:16-alpine` | 5432 (internal) | Relational database — tenants, users, agents, flows, events, audit logs. | `docker-compose.yml:22-38` |
| `tsushin-docker-proxy` | `tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy:latest` | 2375 (internal) | Restricts the Docker API surface to reduce container-escape risk. Backend talks to `tcp://docker-socket-proxy:2375` rather than mounting the raw socket. | `docker-compose.yml:43-75` |
| `tsushin-backend` | Built from `./backend/Dockerfile` | `${TSN_APP_PORT:-8081}` | FastAPI app. Agents, flows, memory, skills, channels, API v1, WebSockets. | `docker-compose.yml:80-168` |
| `tsushin-frontend` | Built from `./frontend/Dockerfile` | `${FRONTEND_PORT:-3030}` | Next.js 16 UI (Watcher, Hub, Studio, Playground, Settings). | `docker-compose.yml:173-195` |
| `kokoro-tts` (profile `tts`) | `ghcr.io/remsky/kokoro-fastapi-cpu:v0.2.4` | 8880 | Optional local text-to-speech. | `docker-compose.yml:200-224` |

**Network:** All services attach to the **external** bridge network `tsushin-network`. The network is declared `external: true`, so `docker compose down` does not remove it. That matters because MCP WhatsApp bot containers (spawned dynamically by `ToolboxContainerService` / `MCPContainerManager`) also join this network. Create the network once with `docker network create tsushin-network`; `install.py` handles this automatically. Source: `docker-compose.yml:229-237`.

**Multi-stack note:** When SSL/Caddy is enabled, proxy upstreams must target stack-scoped container names (for example `tsushin-frontend:3030`, `tsushin-backend:8081`) rather than generic Docker aliases like `frontend` / `backend`. On the shared `tsushin-network`, generic aliases can resolve to another running Tsushin stack.

**Browser → backend request path (v0.6.1):** the Next.js frontend proxies `/api/*` and `/ws/*` to the backend via `rewrites()` declared at `frontend/next.config.mjs`. The destination is read at request time from the `BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL` env var (defaults to `http://backend:8081`, the compose service DNS). This keeps every browser request same-origin with the frontend, so the httpOnly `tsushin_session` cookie (domain-scoped to the frontend) rides along automatically — including the Watcher activity WebSocket at `/ws/watcher/activity`. Replaces the v0.6.0 pattern of baking an absolute `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` into the build, which dropped the cookie on cross-origin access.

**Persistent data:**

| Volume / bind | Container path | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| Docker named volume `tsushin-postgres-data` | `/var/lib/postgresql/data` | PostgreSQL relational data |
| bind `./backend/data` | `/app/data` | ChromaDB vectors, workspaces, backups, legacy SQLite rollback |
| bind `./logs/backend` | `/app/logs` | Structured application logs |
| `tsushin-audio` / `-screenshots` / `-images` | `/tmp/tsushin_*` | Shared with MCP sidecar containers (TTS, browser-automation, image-skill) |

Source: `docker-compose.yml:89-101, 242-259`.

### 2.3 Dynamically-managed MCP containers

Tsushin spawns per-tenant containers outside the compose stack, all joining `tsushin-network`:

* **WhatsApp MCP bots** — one container per connected WhatsApp number, built from the `mcp-agent-tenant` image, managed by `services/mcp_container_manager.py`.
* **Tester surface** — QA bridge status exposed through `/api/mcp/instances/tester/*`; the backend prefers a legacy/compose tester container when present and otherwise falls back to the tenant's active runtime tester instance.
* **Toolbox containers** — per-tenant sandboxes for "Sandboxed Tools" (nmap, dig, nuclei, etc.), managed by `services/toolbox_container_service.py` with base image built from `backend/containers/Dockerfile.toolbox`.

Source: `docker-compose.yml:12-14`, `backend/services/toolbox_container_service.py:114`, `backend/services/mcp_container_manager.py:234`.

---

## 3. Quick Start

### 3.1 Prerequisites

* Docker Engine 20.10+ and Docker Compose V2
* Python 3.8+ with pip (installer only)
* Git
* At least 4 GB RAM available
* A domain name (only if deploying with Let's Encrypt SSL)

Sources: `README.md:17-22`, `docs/docker.md:33-36`.

### 3.2 Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamveene/Tsushin.git
cd Tsushin

# Interactive install (prompts for ports, access type, SSL)
python3 install.py

# Unattended with self-signed HTTPS, auto-detected IP
python3 install.py --defaults

# Unattended with Let's Encrypt (public domain required)
python3 install.py --defaults --domain app.example.com --email you@example.com

# Unattended with Let's Encrypt STAGING (for testing — avoids production rate limits)
python3 install.py --defaults --domain app.example.com --email you@example.com --le-staging

# Unattended HTTP-only (dev/test only — insecure)
python3 install.py --defaults --http

# Custom ports
python3 install.py --port 9090 --frontend-port 3031
```

Source: `README.md:29-48`, `install.py:38-96`. `--http` and `--domain` are mutually exclusive and both require `--defaults`; `--le-staging` requires `--domain`.

#### SSL/TLS modes and troubleshooting

The installer supports four SSL modes, all served through Caddy. Let's Encrypt issuance and renewal is handled by Caddy's built-in ACME client — no separate certbot container is involved.

| Mode | When to use | Cert location |
|---|---|---|
| `disabled` | Local dev behind a VPN, or isolated test harnesses. Ports 80/443 are NOT bound; frontend/backend are exposed on the configured ports. | n/a |
| `selfsigned` | Default for `--defaults` installs without `--domain`. Works on IP-address hosts (e.g., LAN VMs at `10.211.55.5`). Browsers will show a security warning until the cert is trusted. | `caddy/<stack>/certs/selfsigned.{crt,key}` |
| `letsencrypt` | Public-facing deployment with a real domain pointing at this server. Requires ports 80 and 443 reachable from the internet. | Caddy-managed in the `caddy-data` volume |
| `manual` | You already have a cert issued by your own CA or a public CA. Supports an optional chain/intermediate bundle. | `caddy/<stack>/certs/{cert,key}.pem` |

**Self-signed on IP-address hosts.** When the domain passed to the installer is an IPv4/IPv6 literal, the generated certificate's `subjectAltName` now uses the `IP:` entry type (`IP:10.211.55.5`). Emitting `DNS:10.211.55.5` is invalid per RFC 5280 and causes browsers to show `NET::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID`. The Caddyfile's `default_sni` also falls back to `localhost` for IP installs because Caddy rejects IP literals as SNI values.

**Let's Encrypt pre-flight.** Before writing the Caddyfile, the installer (a) resolves the domain via DNS, (b) optionally fetches the server's public IP via `api.ipify.org` and compares it against the resolved IPs, and (c) performs a plain HTTP HEAD on port 80 (the ACME HTTP-01 challenge path). Mismatches and unreachable hosts surface as warnings — valid configurations behind Cloudflare proxy / CDN / NAT can still proceed.

**LE rate-limit recovery.** Production LE limits each account+hostname pair to 5 failed validations per hour. If you hit this limit, re-run the installer with `--le-staging` to test against the staging environment (which has much higher limits) until your setup resolves validation correctly, then repeat without `--le-staging` for a trusted production certificate.

**Manual-cert validation.** The installer validates the cert/key pair before copying it into the Caddy cert directory:

- Key and cert public keys must match — mismatch is a hard error.
- Cert must not be expired — expired is a hard error; expiring within 30 days is a warning only.
- Cert SAN/CN must cover the configured domain — otherwise the installer asks for confirmation before proceeding.
- Optional chain file is parsed and its first cert's subject is compared to the leaf cert's issuer for basic sanity.

When a chain file is supplied, the installer concatenates `cert + chain` into the destination `caddy/<stack>/certs/cert.pem` (Caddy reads a single bundled PEM — no Caddyfile change needed).

**Common errors and fixes.**

- `tls: private key does not match certificate` at Caddy startup → cert/key pair mismatch. The installer now catches this before deploy and refuses to continue.
- Browser shows `NET::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID` on an IP-based self-signed install → regenerate the cert with the updated installer; the SAN will now contain `IP:<addr>` instead of `DNS:<addr>`.
- Frontend API calls 404 or hit CORS after switching SSL mode → historically caused by the Next.js image caching `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`. The installer now detects changes to this value and runs `docker compose build --no-cache frontend` before restarting.

#### New `.env` key

- `SSL_LE_STAGING` (blank or `true`) — when `true`, the generated Caddyfile injects `acme_ca https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory` so Caddy issues certs from LE staging instead of production.

For a remote Ubuntu VM, use the normal user flow: clone the repo on the VM, install Docker plus Docker Compose v2, and run `python3 install.py` from the repository root on that VM. For remote HTTP installs, the installer's final success output uses the public host/IP you entered rather than `localhost`.

For the Parallels audit VM workflow (`parallels@10.211.55.5`), the repository now includes a helper sync script:

```bash
bash deploy-to-vm.sh
```

The script verifies SSH connectivity, checks remote Docker plus Compose, ensures `requests` and `cryptography` are available on the VM, and rsyncs the repository to `~/tsushin` with the usual large/local-only paths excluded (`.git/`, `.private/`, `backend/data/`, `frontend/.next/`, `node_modules/`, logs, backups, and `.env`). After the sync, SSH to the VM and run `sudo python3 install.py` from `~/tsushin`.

The installer automatically:

1. Installs `requests` and `cryptography` via pip.
2. Creates the `tsushin-network` Docker bridge if absent.
3. Generates `.env` with random `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `TSN_MASTER_KEY`.
4. Sets `HOST_BACKEND_DATA_PATH` to the absolute host path of `backend/data` (required for Docker-in-Docker volume mounts).
5. Builds backend + frontend images and starts the stack.
6. (If SSL) Generates `caddy/<stack-name>/Caddyfile` with stack-scoped upstreams plus matching self-signed cert or Let's Encrypt configuration.

Source: `install.py:49-53`, `docker-compose.yml:131-134` (HOST_BACKEND_DATA_PATH is required in `.env`).

### 3.3 Complete setup via browser

Open the URL printed at the end of install (e.g. `https://localhost`, `http://localhost:3030`, or `http://<public-host>:3030` for remote HTTP) and finish the `/setup` wizard:

1. Create admin account + organization.
2. Configure at least one AI provider API key (Gemini, Claude, OpenAI, Groq, Grok, DeepSeek, Ollama, OpenRouter).
3. The wizard automatically creates **ProviderInstance** records for each supported provider key entered during setup. The selected primary provider is also assigned as the **System AI** — no manual post-setup Hub provisioning is required for the providers entered in the wizard.
4. At completion, the wizard reveals an auto-generated **global admin** email/password pair. Record these credentials before leaving the completion screen; they are required for `/system/*` validation and system-level administration.
5. On first login an **onboarding tour** (12 steps) auto-opens. Steps 1 and 6–12 walk through platform areas (Welcome → Watcher → Studio → Hub → Channels → Flows → Playground → You're All Set). Steps 2–5 are a **"What's New in v0.6.0"** showcase covering (2) the expanded AI provider catalogue — Vertex AI, Grok, Groq, ElevenLabs — (3) the new Slack / Discord / Webhook channels, (4) Custom Skills & MCP Servers, and (5) A2A agent-to-agent permissioning plus external vector stores for long-term memory. Each showcase step includes a one-click deep-link to the relevant Hub tab or sub-page.
6. The tour highlights mandatory next steps: **connect a communication channel** (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, or a generic Webhook) via the Hub to enable agent messaging.
7. The **User Guide** is accessible anytime via the **?** button in the header.

**LLM provider keys are configured per-tenant through the Hub UI — not in environment variables.** This enables multi-tenant isolation. Source: `README.md:398`.

The fresh-install regression checklist used on the Ubuntu VM is maintained as an internal deployment playbook. The current checklist covers 13 first-run cases: infrastructure health, tenant/global-admin login, Watcher, Studio, Playground basic chat, Memory Inspector, Flows, Hub, all 15 Settings routes, the 4 System admin routes, conditional Browser Automation, and final log review.

For remote Ubuntu VM installs that use a host-level Ollama daemon, start with `http://host.docker.internal:11434` inside Tsushin. If the Docker engine on that host does not resolve `host.docker.internal`, use the container bridge gateway instead (for example `http://172.18.0.1:11434`) and re-test the provider instance from the Hub.

For repetitive QA runs, auth throttling can be raised or temporarily disabled without code changes by setting `TSN_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT` or `TSN_DISABLE_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT=true` in `.env` before recreating the backend container. This is intended for test automation and should not be left enabled on public production installs.

**Installer re-runs are idempotent (v0.6.1):** running `python3 install.py` a second time against an existing install preserves `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, and `ASANA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` from the current `.env`. Fresh values are only generated on true first installs (no existing `.env`) or when a specific key is missing. This prevents the pre-v0.6.1 failure mode where re-runs rotated the postgres password while the postgres data volume still carried the old one — producing `FATAL: password authentication failed for user "tsushin"` and a backend crash loop. Source: `install.py:1317-1339`.

### 3.4 Verify health

```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/api/health      # Liveness (lightweight)
curl http://localhost:8081/api/readiness   # Readiness (checks PostgreSQL)
docker compose ps                          # Container states
```

Source: `backend/api/routes.py:70` (health), `backend/api/routes.py:84` (readiness).

---

## 4. Deployment & Operations

### 4.1 Docker Compose (development / single-host)

Standard lifecycle (**always from the repository root**, never a worktree):

```bash
cd /path/to/tsushin

# Start
docker compose up -d

# Rebuild specific service after code changes
docker compose build --no-cache backend
docker compose up -d backend
docker compose build --no-cache frontend
docker compose up -d frontend

# Logs
docker compose logs -f backend
docker compose logs --tail=100 backend

# Stop without removing network (SAFE)
docker compose stop backend

# Optional profiles
docker compose --profile tts up -d        # Add Kokoro TTS

# Tester note
# The current repo does not define a `testing` compose profile.
# Hub tester controls resolve a legacy tester container when present,
# or the active runtime tester instance for the tenant.
```

Source: `docs/docker.md:114-169`, `docker-compose.yml:220-226` (tts profile).

### 4.2 Container rebuild safety (SAFE vs UNSAFE)

**SAFE:** `docker compose build --no-cache <service>` followed by `docker compose up -d <service>` rebuilds individual services without touching the `tsushin-network` bridge. MCP WhatsApp bot containers keep their WebSocket sessions alive.

**UNSAFE:** `docker compose down` — the external network now survives it, but it still stops and removes the compose-managed services. You should avoid `down` for routine rebuilds; only use it when you genuinely need to reset Postgres or recreate containers from scratch.

**Session recovery if WhatsApp drops:**

```bash
docker logs mcp-agent-tenant_<id> --tail=10   # Look for QR-code re-auth loop
docker restart mcp-agent-tenant_<id>          # Restart, then re-scan QR from phone
```

### 4.3 Kubernetes / GKE (Helm chart)

Tsushin ships a Helm chart at `k8s/tsushin/`:

```
k8s/tsushin/
├── Chart.yaml              # name: tsushin, version: 0.1.0, appVersion: 0.6.0
├── values.yaml             # Default values
├── values-dev.yaml         # Dev overrides
├── values-prod.yaml        # Prod overrides (HPA, network policies, managed TLS)
└── templates/              # K8s manifest templates
```

Source: `k8s/tsushin/Chart.yaml:1-15`.

K8s mode is activated by setting `TSN_CONTAINER_RUNTIME=kubernetes`. The backend then uses the **K8sRuntime** backend (`backend/services/container_runtime.py:848-849, 1772`) which maps Docker operations (create, start, stop, exec) to K8s Deployments, Services, and `kubectl exec` API. Namespace and image-pull policy are controlled by `TSN_K8S_NAMESPACE` (default `tsushin`) and `TSN_K8S_IMAGE_PULL_POLICY` (default `IfNotPresent`). Source: `backend/settings.py:147-148`.

Features of the Helm chart (per `README.md:261-268`):

* Cloud SQL Proxy sidecar for managed PostgreSQL.
* Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA).
* Network policies for east-west traffic control.
* Managed TLS via GCP-managed certificates.
* `/api/readiness` as the K8s readiness probe, `/api/health` as liveness.
* Prometheus metrics scraped from `/metrics`.
* Structured JSON logs via `TSN_LOG_FORMAT=json`.

### 4.4 GCP Secret Manager backend

Tsushin's secret retrieval is abstracted behind a `SecretProvider` interface. Activate the GCP provider with `TSN_SECRET_BACKEND=gcp` (default is `env`, which reads `os.environ`).

Source: `backend/services/secret_provider.py:286-304`, `backend/settings.py:19-24`.

GCP provider features (`services/secret_provider.py:148-267`):

* **Bootstrap env vars** (always read directly from `os.environ`, not from the provider): `TSN_GCP_PROJECT_ID` (**required**, hard-fails if unset), `TSN_GCP_SECRET_PREFIX` (default `tsushin`), `TSN_GCP_SECRET_VERSION` (default `latest`), `TSN_GCP_SECRET_CACHE_TTL` (seconds, default `300`).
* **Thread-safe TTL cache** — cached secrets are reused across workers within `TSN_GCP_SECRET_CACHE_TTL`.
* **Parallel warm-up** at startup.
* **Three-tier fallback:** GCP Secret Manager → `os.environ` → default value. Used when GCP is briefly unavailable (`services/secret_provider.py:203, 228, 267`).

**Secret naming:** A key `JWT_SECRET_KEY` with prefix `tsushin` becomes GCP secret `tsushin_JWT_SECRET_KEY` (or similar — confirm naming convention with `services/secret_provider.py`). Source: `backend/settings.py:142-144`.

### 4.5 Startup & Seeding Sequence

`db.init_database()` runs on every backend startup (called from `main.py`). It is fully idempotent — running it on an already-initialised DB is safe.

**PostgreSQL path:**
1. `alembic upgrade head` — applies any pending schema migrations.
2. Fall-through to shared seeding block below.

**SQLite path (dev / fallback):**
1. `Base.metadata.create_all()` — creates tables from ORM metadata.
2. Legacy inline migrations (FTS5, sentinel column, MCP auth, Discord/Slack, remote-access).
3. Fall-through to shared seeding block below.

**Shared seeding block (both backends):**

| Step | Function | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Default config | inline | `db.py` | Creates `Config` row if none exists. |
| RBAC defaults | `seed_rbac_defaults()` | `db.py` | Roles + permissions; idempotent. |
| RBAC upgrade | `ensure_rbac_permissions()` | `db.py` | Adds any permissions missing from older installs. |
| Slash commands | `seed_slash_commands()` | `db.py` | 36 system-wide commands (en, pt, …). |
| Project command patterns | `seed_project_command_patterns()` | `db.py` | 10 patterns. |
| Personas | `seed_default_personas()` | `services/persona_seeding.py` | 4 system personas. |
| Tone presets | `seed_default_tone_presets()` | `services/tone_preset_seeding.py` | 4 presets. |
| Shell security patterns | `seed_default_security_patterns()` | `services/shell_pattern_seeding.py` | |
| Sentinel config | `seed_sentinel_config()` + migrations | `services/sentinel_seeding.py` | Detection types, security profiles. |
| **Subscription plans** | `seed_subscription_plans()` | `services/plan_seeding.py` | 4 plans: free / pro / team / enterprise. **Added v0.6.1** — fixes PostgreSQL fresh-install gap. |

**Per-startup jobs** (called from `app.py` lifespan, not `init_database`):
- `backfill_shell_skill_all_tenants()` — ensures every agent has a shell skill row.
- `SandboxedToolSeeder.seed_all_tenants()` — upserts tool manifests from `backend/tools/manifests/*.yaml`.

---

---

## 5. System Configuration

All runtime configuration is driven by environment variables prefixed with `TSN_`. Most variables have backward-compatible legacy names without the prefix. Secret retrieval is routed through the `SecretProvider` abstraction so the same code path works with plain `.env` files or external vaults.

Switch between providers with `TSN_SECRET_BACKEND`:

| Value | Provider | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `env` (default) | `EnvSecretProvider` | Reads `.env` and `os.environ`. |
| `gcp` | `GcpSecretManagerProvider` | Fetches from Google Secret Manager with a 3-tier fallback and in-memory cache (TTL `TSN_GCP_SECRET_CACHE_TTL`, default 300s). |

Source: `backend/settings.py:19-24`, `backend/services/secret_provider.py:148-267`.

**The complete alphabetised env-var reference, with defaults, purposes, and source citations, is in [Appendix A](#29-appendix-a-complete-environment-variable-reference).** The most critical variables every operator needs to set are:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | JWT signing key (required). Generate with `python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"`. |
| `TSN_MASTER_KEY` | Fernet key that wraps all per-service encryption keys stored in the DB. Required for SaaS deployments. Generate with `python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"`. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string (production). Defaults to SQLite for development. |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Set by `install.py`; consumed by `tsushin-postgres` container. |
| `HOST_BACKEND_DATA_PATH` | Absolute host path of `./backend/data` — required for Docker-in-Docker volume mounts in dynamically spawned MCP/toolbox containers. |
| `TSN_APP_HOST` / `TSN_APP_PORT` | Backend bind address and port (defaults: `127.0.0.1` / `8081`). |
| `TSN_BACKEND_URL` / `TSN_FRONTEND_URL` | Public URLs used for OAuth callbacks and CORS. |
| `TSN_STACK_NAME` | Stack prefix used for compose services plus runtime-created vector-store, MCP, toolbox, and volume names. |
| `TSN_CORS_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated allowed origins. Defaults to `*` — restrict in production. |
| `TSN_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT` / `TSN_DISABLE_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT` | Auth throttle controls for login/signup/setup/reset/SSO. Use the disable flag only for QA/dev bursts. |
| `TSN_LOG_LEVEL` / `TSN_LOG_FORMAT` | Logging (`INFO` / `text`). Set `TSN_LOG_FORMAT=json` for structured logs. |

Configuration is grouped by subsystem in Appendix A:

1. Application & URLs
2. Database & storage
3. Authentication & encryption keys
4. Logging & observability
5. Channel behaviour
6. Cleanup & maintenance workers
7. OAuth token refresh worker
8. Channel health & circuit breakers
9. Container runtime (Docker/Kubernetes)
10. External services (Kokoro TTS, Groq, ElevenLabs)
11. GCP & Kubernetes specifics

## 6. Authentication & Access

### 6.1 Login flows

All authentication endpoints live under `/api/auth/` (`backend/auth_routes.py:69`). Rate limiting is enforced by `slowapi` (MED-004, `auth_routes.py:22-24, 66-67`) and is configurable per install via `TSN_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT`. QA or local development can temporarily disable those auth throttles with `TSN_DISABLE_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT=true`; the installer defaults HTTP-only / self-signed installs to a higher `30/minute` login ceiling while leaving public HTTPS installs on the stricter default.

| Method | Path | Purpose | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | Email + password login. Returns JWT in response body and in `tsushin_session` httpOnly cookie. | `auth_routes.py:245` |
| POST | `/api/auth/signup` | New-tenant signup (creates Tenant + Owner user). | `auth_routes.py:299` |
| GET | `/api/auth/setup-status` | Returns whether the `/setup` wizard has been completed. | `auth_routes.py:342` |
| POST | `/api/auth/setup-wizard` | One-shot bootstrap endpoint — creates first tenant + global-admin account. | `auth_routes.py:349` |
| POST | `/api/auth/password-reset/request` | Send password-reset email with token. | `auth_routes.py:624` |
| POST | `/api/auth/password-reset/confirm` | Consume reset token + set new password. | `auth_routes.py:648` |
| GET | `/api/auth/me` | Current user profile. | `auth_routes.py:683` |
| PUT | `/api/auth/me` | Update current user profile. | `auth_routes.py:723` |
| POST | `/api/auth/change-password` | Self-service password change. | `auth_routes.py:741` |
| POST | `/api/auth/logout` | Clears session cookie. | `auth_routes.py:776` |
| GET | `/api/auth/invitation/{token}` | Fetch invitation metadata (tenant, role, inviter). | `auth_routes.py:809` |
| POST | `/api/auth/invitation/{token}/accept` | Accept invite, create user, return JWT. | `auth_routes.py:854` |
| GET | `/api/auth/google/status` | Per-tenant Google SSO config status. | `auth_routes.py:988` |
| GET | `/api/auth/google/authorize` | Return Google OAuth URL to begin SSO. | `auth_routes.py:1050` |
| GET | `/api/auth/google/callback` | Google OAuth callback. Redirects to frontend with a one-time exchange code (MED-009). | `auth_routes.py:1087` |
| POST | `/api/auth/sso-exchange` | Exchange one-time code for JWT. | `auth_routes.py:1151` |
| POST | `/api/auth/google/link` | Link Google account to existing user. | `auth_routes.py:1196` |
| DELETE | `/api/auth/google/unlink` | Unlink Google. | `auth_routes.py:1234` |

**Session cookie** (`auth_routes.py:43-61`):

* Name: `tsushin_session`
* `httpOnly=true`, `SameSite=Lax`, `max_age=86400` (24 h, matches JWT expiry)
* `secure` flag is set when `TSN_SSL_MODE` is anything other than `""`, `off`, `none`, `disabled`.

### 6.2 Multi-tenancy model

Tenants are first-class entities defined by the `tenant` table (`backend/models_rbac.py:16-41`). Key columns:

| Column | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `id` (String(50)) | Tenant identifier (e.g. `tenant_20251202232822`). |
| `slug` (unique) | URL-safe identifier. |
| `plan` / `plan_id` | Legacy plan string (`'free'`) **and** FK to `subscription_plan` row. Both are populated on signup. Plans are seeded at startup by `backend/services/plan_seeding.py`. |
| `max_users`, `max_agents`, `max_monthly_requests` | Quota columns. Defaults: `max_users=5`, `max_agents=10`, `max_monthly_requests=10000`. |
| `status` | `active`, `suspended`, or `trial`. |
| `slash_commands_default_policy` | `enabled_for_known` (default) / `enabled_for_all` / `disabled`. |
| `audit_retention_days` | Default 90. |

Users map to tenants via `UserRole(user_id, role_id, tenant_id)` — one role per user per tenant (unique index `uq_user_tenant`, `models_rbac.py:140-142`). A **global admin** (`User.is_global_admin=True`) may have `tenant_id=NULL` and operates across all tenants.

### 6.3 RBAC roles & permissions matrix

Seeded roles (`backend/migrations/add_rbac_tables.py:405-410`):

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| `owner` | Full control, including billing and team management. |
| `admin` | Everything except `billing.write`. |
| `member` | Standard user — create/manage own resources, no deletes of cross-tenant resources, no user-management. |
| `readonly` | View-only. |

Full role → permission mapping is defined in `backend/migrations/add_rbac_tables.py:422-495`. See Appendix B for the complete list of permission strings.

### 6.4 Global Admin vs Tenant Admin

| Concept | Tenant Admin | Global Admin |
|---|---|---|
| DB flag | `UserRole.role='admin'` for a given `tenant_id` | `User.is_global_admin=True` |
| Scope | One tenant | All tenants, plus `/api/tenants` CRUD, plans, SSO config, system integrations |
| Can create tenants? | No | Yes (`POST /api/tenants`, `routes_tenants.py:203`) |
| Can manage system integrations? | No | Yes (`system_integration` table, `models_rbac.py:183-199`) |
| Permission short-circuit | Must match specific permission strings | `ApiCaller.has_permission()` returns True for **any** permission when `is_global_admin` is set (`backend/api/api_auth.py:40-43`) |

Every global-admin action is recorded in the `global_admin_audit_log` table (`models_rbac.py:217-230`).

## 7. Agents

Agents are AI assistants scoped to a tenant, each linked to a `Contact` record (role="agent") and configurable for multi-channel operation. Stored in the `agent` table.

Source: `backend/models.py:300-392` (Agent model)

### 7.1 Create / Edit Agent Form

The "Create New Agent" modal on Studio → Agents exposes the fields below.
Source: `frontend/app/agents/page.tsx:22-36` (form interface) and `:726-990` (form JSX).

| Field | Type | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Agent Name (`agent_name`) | text, required | Stored on the linked Contact as `friendly_name`. | `frontend/app/agents/page.tsx:728-737` |
| Phone Number (`agent_phone`) | text, optional | Used to populate the agent Contact's WhatsApp phone identifier. | `:740-748` |
| System Prompt (`system_prompt`) | textarea, required | May include `{{PERSONA}}` or `{{TONE}}` placeholders. | `:751-759`, model at `backend/models.py:314` |
| Persona (`persona_id`) | select, optional | FK to Persona; displayed as "Name — Role". | `:762-775`, model at `models.py:316` |
| Tone Preset (`tone_preset_id`) vs. Custom Tone (`custom_tone`) | radio + select/textarea | Legacy — persona_id is preferred. | `:778-821`, model at `models.py:319-320` |
| Trigger Keywords (`keywords`) | tag list | Case-insensitive triggers for group chats. | `:823-850`, model at `models.py:323` |
| Model Provider (`model_provider`) | select | `anthropic`, `openai`, `gemini`, `ollama`, `openrouter` (UI list); DB also permits `groq`, `grok`. | `:40-75`, `:864-889`, model at `models.py:329` |
| Model Name (`model_name`) | select or free-text (OpenRouter supports custom `provider/model-name`) | Auto-populated from the provider's model list. | `:891-968`, model at `models.py:330` |
| Active (`is_active`) | checkbox, default true | `models.py:379` |
| Default (`is_default`) | checkbox | Marks the agent as default for new chats. | `:981-989`, `models.py:380` |

Edit-time fields beyond the modal (surfaced in `AgentConfigurationManager` / Agent detail page tabs):
- `description` — short human-readable description (`models.py:315`)
- `response_template` — default `"@{agent_name}: {response}"` (`models.py:333`)
- `avatar` slug — e.g. samurai, robot, ninja (`models.py:376`)
- `provider_instance_id` — binds to a configured `ProviderInstance` so API keys/base URLs come from the tenant's provider configuration. (`models.py:369`, `models.py:437-458`)
- `vector_store_instance_id` + `vector_store_mode` (`override|complement|shadow`) — Vector store binding. (`models.py:372-373`)
- `enabled_channels` JSON — any of `playground, whatsapp, telegram, slack, discord, webhook`. (`models.py:363`)
- `whatsapp_integration_id`, `telegram_integration_id`, `slack_integration_id`, `discord_integration_id`, `webhook_integration_id` — per-channel FKs. (`models.py:364-368`)

The agent detail page (`frontend/app/agents/[id]/page.tsx:18-20`) provides six tabs: Configuration, Channels, Memory Management, Skills, Knowledge Base, Shared Knowledge.

### 7.2 Memory Modes & Memory Size

Fields on the Agent model (Source: `backend/models.py:337-359`):

| Field | Type | Default | Values |
|---|---|---|---|
| `memory_size` | Integer (nullable) | system default | Ring buffer length per sender. |
| `memory_isolation_mode` | String(20) | `"isolated"` | `isolated` \| `shared` \| `channel_isolated` |
| `enable_semantic_search` | Boolean | True | Toggle semantic memory per agent. |
| `semantic_search_results` | Integer | 10 | Max semantic results returned. |
| `semantic_similarity_threshold` | Float | 0.5 | Range 0.0–1.0. |
| `chroma_db_path` | String(500) | NULL | Per-agent ChromaDB directory override. |
| `memory_decay_enabled` | Boolean | False | Enable temporal decay. |
| `memory_decay_lambda` | Float | 0.01 | Exponential decay rate (~69-day half-life). |
| `memory_decay_archive_threshold` | Float | 0.05 | Auto-archive below this score. |
| `memory_decay_mmr_lambda` | Float | 0.5 | MMR diversity weight. |

Semantics:
- **isolated** — each sender key has its own ring buffer. For threaded Playground/API chats, Tsushin uses a canonical thread-scoped sender key, so one thread cannot recall another thread's isolated memory.
- **shared** — buffer is shared across senders for the agent.
- **channel_isolated** — buffer is partitioned per channel (whatsapp/telegram/playground…). Separate threads inside the same channel share the channel buffer, but the UI/API still filters message history per thread.
- Thread-aware Playground reads (`history`, `memory`, and clear-history operations) accept an optional `thread_id` and resolve the same canonical identity used on writes, so thread-scoped history does not drift from the underlying memory mode.

### 7.3 Per-Agent Trigger & Context Overrides

These fields on the Agent model allow per-agent overrides for messaging triggers and group context. When set to `NULL`, the system/tenant default from the `Config` table is used.

Source: `backend/models.py:342-354`.

| Field | Type | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `trigger_dm_enabled` | Boolean (nullable) | NULL (system default) | Enable/disable DM auto-response for this agent. When `true`, the agent responds to direct messages from unknown senders. |
| `trigger_group_filters` | JSON (nullable) | NULL (system default) | List of WhatsApp group names this agent monitors, overriding `Config.group_filters`. Example: `["Support Group", "VIP Chat"]` |
| `trigger_number_filters` | JSON (nullable) | NULL (system default) | List of phone numbers this agent monitors, overriding `Config.number_filters`. Example: `["+5511999990001"]` |
| `context_message_count` | Integer (nullable) | NULL (system default) | Number of recent group messages fetched for context before responding. |
| `context_char_limit` | Integer (nullable) | NULL (system default) | Character limit for the context window sent to the LLM. |

**Configuration example** — Agent "SupportBot" with custom trigger settings:

```json
{
  "trigger_dm_enabled": true,
  "trigger_group_filters": ["Support Group", "VIP Chat"],
  "trigger_number_filters": ["+5511999990001", "+5511999990002"],
  "context_message_count": 15,
  "context_char_limit": 8000
}
```

These overrides are applied at the trigger/routing layer (`backend/mcp_reader/`) and `AgentRouter` (`backend/agent/agent_router.py`). The system default is inherited from the tenant `Config` row (`backend/models.py:19-20`). See also §15.1 for instance-level WhatsApp filters.

### 7.4 Cloning Agents

Cloning is performed via the agents API (`api.deleteAgent`, `api.updateAgent` exposed in `frontend/app/agents/page.tsx`). The Persona/Skills entities have dedicated Clone buttons (`frontend/app/agents/personas/page.tsx:185-203` — handleClonePersona); per-agent cloning follows the same duplicate-form pattern — not verified in source at the agent page level (confirm via `backend/api/routes_agents.py`).

### 7.5 Multi-Agent Orchestration

Two skills drive inter-agent behavior:

- **Agent Switcher Skill** — `skill_type="agent_switcher"`, `execution_mode="hybrid"` (default as of v0.6.0). "Allows users to switch their default agent for direct messages via natural language commands." Claims detection-type exemption for `agent_takeover`.
  Source: `backend/agent/skills/agent_switcher_skill.py:37-43`

- **Agent Communication Skill (A2A)** — `skill_type="agent_communication"`, `execution_mode="tool"`. "Ask other agents questions, discover available agents, or delegate tasks."
  Source: `backend/agent/skills/agent_communication_skill.py:28-31`

**Agent Switcher execution modes** (v0.6.0):

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `tool` | LLM decides via MCP tool schema only. No keyword scanning. |
| `legacy` | Keyword-only path (e.g., "Switch me to Support"). |
| `hybrid` | **Default.** Both paths active — keyword triggers fire deterministically, and the LLM can also call the tool by name. Prevents keyword-only misses while keeping tool-calling precision. |

Set the mode per-agent in Studio → Skills → Agent Switcher → Config. The schema is defined at `backend/agent/skills/agent_switcher_skill.py:505-509`.

The Studio → Agent Communication page (`frontend/app/agents/communication/page.tsx`) mounts `AgentCommunicationManager` to manage inter-agent messaging permissions and monitor communication sessions.

## 8. Personas & Tone Presets

### 8.1 Persona Form

Persona form fields on the create/edit modal (Source: `frontend/app/agents/personas/page.tsx:15-28`, JSX `:419-564`, DB at `backend/models.py:242-297`).

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | text, required (unique per tenant) | `models.py:253` |
| `description` | textarea, required | `models.py:254` |
| `role` | text | e.g., "Customer Support Specialist" — `models.py:257` |
| `role_description` | textarea | Detailed responsibilities — `models.py:258` |
| `personality_traits` | text | e.g., "Empathetic, patient, enthusiastic" — `models.py:265` |
| `tone_preset_id` / `custom_tone` | radio + select or textarea | Tone source (preset or free text) — `models.py:261-262` |
| `guardrails` | textarea | Safety rules/constraints — `models.py:283` |
| `is_active` | checkbox | `models.py:289` |

Additional fields stored (populated via Persona builder/APIs rather than this modal):
- `enabled_skills` (JSON list of Skill IDs) — `models.py:268`
- `enabled_sandboxed_tools` (JSON list of SandboxedTool IDs, alias `enabled_custom_tools`) — `models.py:270, 274-280`
- `enabled_knowledge_bases` (JSON list of KB IDs) — `models.py:271`
- `ai_summary` — auto-generated persona summary (custom personas only) — `models.py:286`
- `is_system` — True for built-in personas — `models.py:290`

System-persona names are read-only in the UI (`personas/page.tsx:431`).

### 8.2 Tone Preset Library

Source: `backend/models.py:222-239` (TonePreset model) and `backend/services/tone_preset_seeding.py`.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | String(50), unique per tenant | e.g., "Friendly", "Professional", "Humorous" |
| `description` | Text, required | The tone phrase injected into system prompts. |
| `is_system` | Boolean, default False | True for built-in presets. |
| `tenant_id` | String(50), nullable | NULL = shared/system preset. |

Seeded presets are created by `tone_preset_seeding.py` at install/bootstrap.

---

## 9. Skills

### 9.1 Built-in Skills Catalog

Each entry below is taken directly from the skill's class attributes. Config is inherited from `BaseSkill.get_config_schema()` (keywords, use_ai_fallback, ai_model) unless the subclass overrides.
Common base schema source: `backend/agent/skills/base.py:183-227`.

| skill_type | skill_name | execution_mode | Description | Source file |

| `custom` (base) | Custom Skill | tool | Adapter for tenant-authored custom skills. `skill_type` becomes `custom:{slug}` at runtime | `custom_skill_adapter.py:25-37` |

Execution modes (Source: `backend/agent/skills/base.py:71-78`):
- `legacy`/`programmatic` — keyword or slash command only (no LLM tool call).
- `tool`/`agentic` — exposed as an LLM function-call tool.
- `hybrid` — both tool and legacy modes.
- `passive` — post-processing hook (no direct trigger).
- `special` — media-triggered (e.g., audio).

All skills inherit the base config schema:

```json
{"type":"object","properties":{
  "keywords": {"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"default":[]},
  "use_ai_fallback": {"type":"boolean","default":true},
  "ai_model": {"type":"string","enum":["gemini-2.5-flash","gpt-3.5-turbo","claude-haiku"],"default":"gemini-2.5-flash"}
}}
```
Source: `backend/agent/skills/base.py:204-227`. Individual skills override to add their own fields (e.g., `scheduler_skill.py:1081`, `gmail_skill.py:1136-1138`, `browser_automation_skill.py:725`, `image_skill.py:659`).

### 9.2 Per-Agent Skill Binding & Config

Bindings are stored in the `agent_skill` table (Source: `backend/models.py:712` — class AgentSkill). Each row associates an `agent_id` + `skill_type` with an `is_enabled` flag, a per-agent `execution_mode` override, and a JSON `config` blob validated against the skill's `get_config_schema()`.

The Skills tab on the agent detail page (`frontend/app/agents/[id]/page.tsx:218-220`, component `AgentSkillsManager`) lists available skills from the `SkillManager` catalog (Source: `backend/agent/skills/skill_manager.py:146-184`) and renders a per-skill config modal using the returned `config_schema`.

`image_analysis` is media-triggered rather than tool-triggered. It activates on inbound image attachments, uses Gemini multimodal models to analyze the image, and returns a direct response with `skip_ai=true`. If the image caption looks like an edit request ("remove background", "change this", etc.), the skill intentionally defers so the existing `image` editing skill can handle the request instead.

### 9.3 Custom Skills (Instruction / Script / MCP Server)

Custom skills are tenant-authored skills registered under `backend/api/routes_custom_skills.py` and managed via Studio → Custom Skills (`frontend/app/agents/custom-skills/page.tsx`).

**Resource quotas** (Source: `routes_custom_skills.py:33-35`):
- Max instruction length: **8,000 characters**
- Max script size: **256 KB**
- Max skills per tenant: **50**

**Common schema fields** (Source: `routes_custom_skills.py:59-77`):

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string, required | — | Skill display name |
| `description` | string | null | Short description |
| `icon` | string | null | Icon identifier |
| `skill_type_variant` | string | `"instruction"` | `instruction` \| `script` \| `mcp_server` |
| `execution_mode` | string | `"tool"` | `tool` (LLM-facing) \| `passive` (post-processing) |
| `trigger_mode` | string | `"llm_decided"` | `llm_decided` (LLM decides when to call) \| `keyword` \| `always` |
| `trigger_keywords` | string[] | `[]` | Keywords that activate the skill (when `trigger_mode=keyword`) |
| `timeout_seconds` | integer | `30` | Execution timeout |
| `priority` | integer | `50` | Priority order (lower = higher priority) |
| `sentinel_profile_id` | integer | null | Security profile for Sentinel scan at save-time |
| `input_schema` | object | `{}` | JSON Schema for skill input parameters |

Lifecycle fields rendered in UI: `scan_status` (`pending`, `clean`, `rejected`, `unknown`), `last_scan_result`, `skill_type_variant` (Source: `:20-66`). Deployment handled by `backend/services/custom_skill_deploy_service.py`.

At runtime, custom skills are adapted by `CustomSkillAdapter` (Source: `backend/agent/skills/custom_skill_adapter.py:25-53`): its `skill_type` becomes `"custom:{slug}"`, `skill_name` and `execution_mode` are pulled from the database record; `passive` adapters have no `can_handle`.

#### 9.3.1 Instruction Skills

Natural-language instructions executed by the LLM as a tool. The simplest custom skill type — no code required.

**Runtime execution semantics (BUG-509, 2026-04-10):** Instruction skills behave differently depending on `execution_mode`:
- `execution_mode: tool` or `hybrid` (the default) — the skill is exposed to the agent as a callable tool. When the LLM invokes it, `CustomSkillAdapter.execute_tool` routes through `execute_instruction_with_llm`, which runs the `instructions_md` as a system prompt against the tenant's LLM and returns the LLM's processed output. This is the same code path that the `/api/custom-skills/{id}/test` endpoint uses, so the `/test` and runtime paths now always agree. Every runtime invocation writes a `CustomSkillExecution` history row just like `/test`.
- `execution_mode: passive` — the skill's `instructions_md` is concatenated into the agent's system prompt as always-on context and the skill is NOT exposed as a callable tool. Use this when you want the instructions to shape every response rather than be selectively invoked.

Before 2026-04-10, all instruction skills had their raw `instructions_md` dumped into the system prompt regardless of execution mode, which caused the LLM to parrot the template back verbatim when invoked. Passive mode is now the only path that injects raw instructions.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `instructions_md` | string (max 8,000 chars) | Markdown instructions executed by the LLM (tool/hybrid mode) or injected as always-on context (passive mode) |

**Example — Create a "Policy Lookup" instruction skill:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/custom-skills \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Policy Lookup",
    "description": "Answers questions about company policies",
    "skill_type_variant": "instruction",
    "execution_mode": "tool",
    "trigger_mode": "llm_decided",
    "instructions_md": "When asked about company policies, search the knowledge base for relevant policy documents. Always cite the policy name and section number. If no policy is found, say so clearly.",
    "timeout_seconds": 30
  }'
```

#### 9.3.2 Script Skills

Executable scripts deployed to a sandboxed container. Supports Python, Bash, and Node.js. The runtime executes the script file and reads stdout (plain text or JSON with an `output` field). Returning a value from a function without printing it does not produce usable output, and `/api/custom-skills/{id}/test` now fails closed when stdout is blank.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `script_content` | string (max 256 KB) | The script source code |
| `script_language` | string | `python` \| `bash` \| `nodejs` |
| `script_entrypoint` | string | Entry file to execute (e.g., `run.py`). Bare names (e.g., `run`) are auto-extended based on `script_language`, but the file still needs to print its result to stdout. |

**Example — Create a Python data-processing skill:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/custom-skills \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "CSV Analyzer",
    "description": "Analyzes CSV data and returns statistics",
    "skill_type_variant": "script",
    "execution_mode": "tool",
    "script_language": "python",
    "script_entrypoint": "analyze",
    "script_content": "import json\nimport os\n\ninput_data = json.loads(os.environ.get(\"TSUSHIN_INPUT\", \"{}\"))\nrows = input_data.get(\"rows\", [])\nprint(json.dumps({\"output\": json.dumps({\"row_count\": len(rows)})}))",
    "timeout_seconds": 60
  }'
```

#### 9.3.3 MCP Server Skills

Connect to an external MCP-compliant tool server. The skill proxies requests to the MCP server and returns results.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `mcp_server_id` | integer | FK to a registered MCP server integration |
| `mcp_tool_name` | string | The specific tool name exposed by the MCP server |

**Example — Create an MCP Server skill:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/custom-skills \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Database Query",
    "description": "Query the analytics database via MCP",
    "skill_type_variant": "mcp_server",
    "execution_mode": "tool",
    "mcp_server_id": 3,
    "mcp_tool_name": "query_analytics",
    "timeout_seconds": 45
  }'
```

### 9.4 Sandboxed Tools

Command syntax via chat / API: `/tool <tool_name> <command_name> param=value` (e.g. `/tool nmap quick_scan target=scanme.nmap.org`, `/tool dig lookup domain=google.com`). Flags like `--target` are NOT supported — only `param=value`.

Tools are defined via YAML manifests in `backend/tools/manifests/` (`sandboxed_tool_seeding.py:36`) and loaded into `SandboxedTool`/`SandboxedToolCommand`/`SandboxedToolParameter` tables (`models.py`). Container execution is the default (`execution_mode="container"`, Source: `models.py:1347`). The master toolbox image is built from `backend/containers/Dockerfile.toolbox`.

The `sandboxed_tools` skill acts as a passive gate — it grants the agent access to these tools without itself being an LLM-facing tool (`sandboxed_tools_skill.py:36`).

#### 9.4.1 nmap — Network Scanner

## 10. Memory & Knowledge

### 10.1 Four-Layer Architecture

Source: `backend/agent/memory/agent_memory_system.py:1-32`.

- **Layer 1 — Working Memory**: ring buffer of last N messages per sender key, stored in the `memory` table (`messages_json` JSON field). Fast in-context recall. Source: `backend/models.py:130-144`. The `memory` table is keyed by `(tenant_id, agent_id, sender_key)` with a composite index `idx_memory_tenant_agent_sender`; every read and write path filters by `tenant_id` for DB-level cross-tenant isolation (see BUG-LOG-015).
- **Layer 2 — Long-Term Episodic Memory**: unlimited conversation history with semantic search via a vector store (ChromaDB default). Implemented in `SemanticMemoryService` (`backend/agent/memory/semantic_memory.py`).
- **Layer 3 — Semantic Knowledge Base**: learned facts about users, extracted by `FactExtractor` (`backend/agent/memory/fact_extractor.py`) and persisted via `KnowledgeService` (`backend/agent/memory/knowledge_service.py`).
- **Layer 4 — Shared Memory Pool**: cross-agent knowledge, managed by `SharedMemoryPool` (`backend/agent/memory/shared_memory_pool.py`).

Management / inspection services: `MemoryManagementService` (`memory_management_service.py`), `MultiAgentMemory` (`multi_agent_memory.py`), `VectorStoreManager` (`vector_store_manager.py`), `VectorStoreCached` (`vector_store_cached.py`), `ToolOutputBuffer` (`tool_output_buffer.py`).

### 10.2 Knowledge Bases (KB)

Uploads are handled by `POST /api/agents/{agent_id}/knowledge-base/upload` (Source: `backend/api/routes_knowledge_base.py:157-203`).

- Allowed extensions: `.txt`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.pdf`, `.docx` (`:186`).
- Max file size: 50 MB (`:170`).
- Processing is asynchronous (FastAPI BackgroundTasks).
- Required permission: `knowledge.write` (`:164`).

Chunking/embedding configuration is set on the Project (see 17.2) — per-agent uploads use system defaults from `backend/agent/knowledge/document_processor.py`.

Additional endpoints (`routes_knowledge_base.py`):
- `GET /agents/{id}/knowledge-base` — list documents
- `GET /agents/{id}/knowledge-base/stats` — stats
- `GET /agents/{id}/knowledge-base/{knowledge_id}` — detail
- `GET /agents/{id}/knowledge-base/{knowledge_id}/chunks` — chunks
- `POST /agents/{id}/knowledge-base/search` — semantic search over KB
- `POST /agents/{id}/knowledge-base/{knowledge_id}/reprocess` — reprocess

### 10.3 OKG (Ontology Knowledge Graph)

Source: `backend/agent/memory/okg/okg_memory_service.py:1-38`.

Core operations: **store**, **recall**, **forget**, **merge**. Features:
- **MemGuard Layer A** pre-storage validation (security gate).
- Deterministic deduplication by `doc_id` (`sha256(agent_id:user_id:subject:relation:text[:100])[:32]`, `:31-37`).
- Temporal decay scoring.
- Audit logging to `okg_memory_audit_log` (Source: `models.py:3579-3609`).

**Merge modes** (Source: `okg_memory_service.py:28`):

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `merge` (default) | Intelligent merge of new content into existing memory entry |
| `replace` | New value completely overwrites the existing entry |
| `prepend` | New value is prepended to the existing text |

Valid memory types (`okg_memory_service.py:26`): `fact`, `episodic`, `semantic`, `procedural`, `belief`.
Valid sources (`:27`): `tool_call`, `auto_capture`, `import`.

Context injection into LLM calls is done by `OKGContextInjector` (`backend/agent/memory/okg/okg_context_injector.py`). Skill surface: `okg_term_memory` (see 9.1).

### 10.4 Semantic Search Configuration

Per-agent config on the `agent` table (`backend/models.py:350-353`):

| Field | Type | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `enable_semantic_search` | Boolean | True |
| `semantic_search_results` | Integer | 10 |
| `semantic_similarity_threshold` | Float | 0.5 |
| `chroma_db_path` | String(500) | NULL |

### 10.5 Temporal Decay

Source: `backend/agent/memory/temporal_decay.py:14-60`.

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | False | Master switch (agent: `memory_decay_enabled`). |
| `decay_lambda` | 0.01 | Exponential decay rate; ~69-day half-life. |
| `archive_threshold` | 0.05 | Auto-archive memories below this effective score. |
| `mmr_lambda` | 0.5 | MMR diversity weight (0=max diversity, 1=pure relevance). |

Decay factor: `e^(-lambda * days_since_access)`. MMR (Maximum Marginal Relevance) reranking balances relevance against diversity so recall doesn't return near-duplicates. Config is loaded from the Agent row via `DecayConfig.from_agent()` (`temporal_decay.py:27-35`).

---

## 11. Vector Stores

Multi-vendor vector DB support. Each tenant can register one or more `VectorStoreInstance` rows and designate a default; agents can override per-agent via `agent.vector_store_instance_id`.

Model: `backend/models.py:3521-3576` (VectorStoreInstance).
Adapters: `backend/agent/memory/providers/` — `chroma_adapter.py`, `mongodb_adapter.py`, `pinecone_adapter.py`, `qdrant_adapter.py`. All implement `VectorStoreProvider` (`backend/agent/memory/providers/base.py:41-122`).

Common fields on `VectorStoreInstance`:
- `vendor`: `chromadb|mongodb|pinecone|qdrant`
- `instance_name` — unique per tenant
- `base_url`, `credentials_encrypted` (Fernet-encrypted JSON)
- `extra_config` (JSON): vendor-specific (`index_name`, `collection_name`, `namespace`, `embedding_dims`)
- `health_status` (`unknown|healthy|degraded|unavailable`)
- `is_auto_provisioned`, container fields (`container_name`, `container_port`, `container_status`, `container_image`, `volume_name`, `mem_limit`, `cpu_quota`)
- `security_config` (JSON): MemGuard thresholds, rate limits, batch limits

Namespace isolation per agent uses pattern `tsushin_{tenant_id}_{agent_id}` (`providers/base.py:49`).

### 11.1 Chroma (local, default)
Built-in. No external credentials required. Uses `chroma_db_path` per agent or a tenant default.
Adapter: `backend/agent/memory/providers/chroma_adapter.py`.

### 11.2 Pinecone
Cloud-hosted. `base_url` unused; API key stored in `credentials_encrypted`; `extra_config.index_name` + `extra_config.namespace` required.
Adapter: `backend/agent/memory/providers/pinecone_adapter.py`.

### 11.3 Qdrant
Self-hosted or cloud. `base_url` required; `extra_config.collection_name` required.
Adapter: `backend/agent/memory/providers/qdrant_adapter.py`.

### 11.4 MongoDB Atlas
`base_url` required (connection string in credentials); requires Atlas Vector Search.
Adapter: `backend/agent/memory/providers/mongodb_adapter.py`.

### UI

Settings → Vector Stores (`frontend/app/settings/vector-stores/page.tsx:21-125`) lets admins pick the default instance (`api.updateDefaultVectorStore`) and run connection tests (`api.testVectorStoreConnection`). The page renders vendor labels for `mongodb`, `pinecone`, `qdrant` (`:8-12`). Health dots reflect `health_status` (`:14-19`).

Per-agent override uses `agent.vector_store_mode`:
- `override` — agent uses its configured instance only.
- `complement` — agent reads from both its instance and the default.
- `shadow` — writes duplicated to secondary for migration/testing.
Source: `backend/models.py:372-373`.

### Per-Agent Vector Store UI

Studio > Agent > Configuration now includes a **Vector Store** section (`frontend/components/AgentConfigurationManager.tsx`) with:
- Status indicator showing current vector store (per-agent override, tenant default, or ChromaDB built-in)
- Dropdown to select from available vector store instances or "Use Tenant Default"
- Mode selector (Override/Complement/Shadow) shown when an override is selected
- Link to Hub > Vector Stores if no instances are configured

### Post-Creation Agent Attachment Wizard

When creating a new vector store in Hub > Vector Stores (`frontend/components/vector-stores/VectorStoreConfigModal.tsx`), after successful creation an optional "Attach to Agents" step appears:
- Lists all active agents with checkboxes
- Shows which agents already have a vector store override
- Assigns the new store with `override` mode to selected agents
- Skippable — users can attach later via Studio > Agent > Configuration

---

## 12. Security — Sentinel

Sentinel is an AI-powered detection/blocking layer. Registry source: `backend/services/sentinel_detections.py:17-141`. Profiles: `backend/services/sentinel_seeding.py:503-570`. UI: `frontend/app/settings/sentinel/page.tsx`, `frontend/app/agents/security/page.tsx`.

### 12.1 Detection Types (7)

| Key | Name | Severity | Applies to |
|---|---|---|---|
| `prompt_injection` | Prompt Injection | high | prompt |
| `agent_takeover` | Agent Takeover | high | prompt |
| `poisoning` | Poisoning Attack | medium | prompt |
| `shell_malicious` | Malicious Shell Intent | critical | shell |
| `memory_poisoning` | Memory Poisoning (MemGuard) | high | memory |
| `agent_escalation` | Agent Privilege Escalation | high | prompt |
| `browser_ssrf` | Browser SSRF | critical | browser |
| `vector_store_poisoning` | Vector Store Poisoning | high | vector_store |

(8 registry entries — the "7 detection types" referred to at the product level excludes `agent_escalation`, which shipped later.)
Source: `backend/services/sentinel_detections.py:17-141`.

### 12.2 Profiles

Source: `backend/services/sentinel_seeding.py:523-570`.

| Slug | Name | detection_mode | aggressiveness_level | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `off` | Off | `off` | 0 | No analysis. |
| `permissive` | Permissive | `detect_only` | 1 | System-wide default. |
| `moderate` | Moderate | `block` | 1 | Recommended for production. |
| `aggressive` | Aggressive | `block` | 3 | Max sensitivity; more false positives. |
| `custom-skill-scan` | Custom Skill Scan | `block` | 1 | Tuned for custom-skill instruction scanning (disables `agent_takeover`, `poisoning`, `memory_poisoning`). |

Custom profiles per tenant are allowed via `SentinelProfile` records and cloning (`api.SentinelProfileCloneRequest` in `frontend/app/settings/sentinel/page.tsx:15`).

### 12.3 Modes & Aggressiveness

- **detection_mode**: `off` | `warn_only` | `detect_only` | `block`
- **aggressiveness_level**: 0 (off) | 1 (moderate) | 2 (aggressive) | 3 (extra aggressive). Controls which `DEFAULT_PROMPTS` template is used per detection (Source: `sentinel_detections.py:146-196`).

### 12.4 Notifications & WhatsApp Alerts

Channel-based alert dispatching for Sentinel events is handled by `backend/services/channel_alert_dispatcher.py`. Alerts can be routed to specified Contacts (WhatsApp or other channels) when blocks/detections occur. Sentinel general-tab UI exposes notification toggles via `SentinelConfig` (`frontend/app/settings/sentinel/page.tsx:54`).

### 12.5 Exceptions & Allowlists

Exceptions are managed in `backend/services/sentinel_exceptions_service.py:32-186` via the `SentinelException` model. Scope hierarchy (order of checking): system (tenant_id NULL, agent_id NULL) → tenant (tenant_id set, agent_id NULL) → agent (agent_id set).

| Field | Values |
|---|---|
| `exception_type` | `pattern`, `domain`, … |
| `match_mode` | For `pattern`: controls literal/regex/glob matching. |
| `detection_types` | `*` (applies to all) or comma list. |
| `priority` | Higher wins. |
| `is_active` | Boolean. |

Source: `sentinel_exceptions_service.py:86-186`.

### 12.6 Per-Skill Security Overrides

Each skill class publishes `get_sentinel_context()` (expected_intents, expected_patterns, risk_notes) and `get_sentinel_exemptions()` (detection_type keys auto-exempted when the skill is enabled). Source: `backend/agent/skills/base.py:229-280`.

Effective per-skill profile resolution: `backend/services/sentinel_effective_config.py` (composes tenant → agent → skill-level profile assignments, returning `SentinelEffectiveConfig`; see usage in `sentinel_profiles_service.py:555-632`).

Per-agent security UI: `frontend/app/agents/security/page.tsx` mounts per-agent overrides.

---

## 13. Flows

Unified execution engine for reusable workflows. DB: `flow_definition`, `flow_node`, `flow_run`, `flow_node_run`.
Source: `backend/flows/flow_engine.py`, `backend/models.py:1528-1728`.

> **v0.6.0 — Integration resolution (BUG-559):** `flows_skill` now queries `AgentSkillIntegration` first when resolving provider accounts (e.g., Google Calendar, Gmail). This means flows respect the agent's per-skill integration binding set in Studio, and only fall back to system-wide config defaults if no binding exists. Previously the Google Calendar provider was ignored in favor of the config default, causing calendar steps to write to the wrong account.

### 13.1 Flow Types

`flow_definition.flow_type` values (Source: `backend/models.py:1563`): `conversation`, `notification`, `workflow`, `task`.

Initiator types (`models.py:1554`): `programmatic` (UI-created) | `agentic` (AI-created).

### 13.2 Execution Modes

`flow_definition.execution_method` (Source: `models.py:1546`):
- `immediate` — runs on creation/trigger.
- `scheduled` — runs at `scheduled_at` (DateTime).
- `recurring` — driven by `recurrence_rule` JSON: `{frequency, interval, days_of_week, timezone}` (Source: `models.py:1548`).

Scheduled execution is driven by `backend/flows/scheduled_flow_executor.py`. The engine tracks `last_executed_at`, `next_execution_at`, and `execution_count` on the definition (`models.py:1572-1574`).

### 13.3 Step Types

Step handlers registered in `FlowEngine.handlers` (Source: `backend/flows/flow_engine.py:2082-2102`):

| Type | Handler | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `notification` | `NotificationStepHandler` | Sends a notification message to a recipient. Requires `recipient` or `recipients`, plus `message_template` or `content` in `config_json`. |
| `message` | `MessageStepHandler` | Sends a chat message (single-turn). |
| `tool` | `ToolStepHandler` | Invokes a tool/function. |
| `conversation` | `ConversationStepHandler` | Multi-turn AI conversation via `ConversationThread` (up to `max_turns`). |
| `slash_command` | `SlashCommandStepHandler` | Runs a platform slash command. |
| `skill` | `SkillStepHandler` | Agentic skill execution (Phase 16). |
| `custom_skill` | `SkillStepHandler` | Alias for tenant custom skills (Phase 22). |
| `summarization` | `SummarizationStepHandler` | AI summarization. Supports `thread_id`, `source_step`, or inline `text`/`content` in `config_json`. |
| `browser_automation` | `BrowserAutomationStepHandler` | Browser control (navigate/screenshot/click/fill/extract). |
| `Trigger`, `Subflow` + PascalCase aliases | Legacy handlers | Backward compat. |
| `AgentNode` | `ConversationStepHandler` alias | Alias accepted for compatibility (same config as `conversation`). |

Each `flow_node` row carries (Source: `models.py:1586-1639`):

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `name`, `step_description` | Human-readable identity. |
| `type` | One of the handler keys above. |
| `position` | 1-based execution order (unique per flow). |
| `config_json` | Step-type-specific config. |
| `timeout_seconds` | Default 300. |
| `retry_on_failure`, `max_retries`, `retry_delay_seconds` | Retry behavior (exponential backoff). |
| `condition` (JSON) | Conditional execution. |
| `on_success` / `on_failure` | `continue` \| `skip_to:{step}` \| `end` \| `retry` \| `skip` |
| `allow_multi_turn`, `max_turns` (default 20), `conversation_objective` | Conversation step config. |
| `agent_id` | Override flow-level default agent. |
| `persona_id` | Optional persona injection. |

### 13.4 Template Variables

Source: `backend/flows/template_parser.py:1-80`.

Variable references inside step configs/messages:

| Syntax | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `{{step_N.field}}` | Step by 1-based index, e.g. `{{step_1.status}}`. |
| `{{step_name.field}}` | Step by its `name`. |
| `{{previous_step.output}}` / `.summary` | Most recent completed step. |
| `{{flow.trigger_context.param}}` / `{{flow.id}}` | Flow-level context. |
| `{{step_1.raw_output.ports[0]}}` | JSON path with array access. |
| `{{truncate step_1.raw_output 100}}` | Helper function. |
| `{{#if step_1.success}}OK{{else}}FAIL{{/if}}` | Conditional block. |
| `{{default step_1.error "No error"}}` | Default fallback. |

Built-in helpers (Source: `template_parser.py:69-82`): `truncate`, `upper`, `lower`, `default`, `json`, `length`, `first`, `last`, `join`, `replace`, `trim`.

### 13.5 Flow Execution Status Lifecycle

**FlowRun statuses** (Source: `models.py:1663`):

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pending` | Queued but not yet started |
| `running` | Currently executing steps |
| `completed` | All steps finished successfully |
| `failed` | One or more steps failed |
| `cancelled` | Manually cancelled by user or system |
| `paused` | Execution paused (e.g., conversation step awaiting response) |
| `timeout` | Exceeded time limit, auto-terminated |

**FlowNodeRun (step-level) statuses** (Source: `models.py:1708`):

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pending` | Step queued, awaiting execution |
| `running` | Step currently executing |
| `completed` | Step finished successfully |
| `failed` | Step failed (may retry based on `retry_on_failure` config) |
| `skipped` | Step skipped due to condition or `on_failure=skip` |
| `cancelled` | Step cancelled (parent flow cancelled) |
| `timeout` | Step exceeded `timeout_seconds` |

### 13.6 Async Execution & Live Progress Modal

Flow execution via `POST /api/flows/{flow_id}/execute` is fully asynchronous. The endpoint creates a `FlowRun` record with status `pending`, returns it immediately (HTTP 202), and executes steps in a background task. The frontend's `ViewRunModal` opens instantly and polls `GET /api/flows/runs/{run_id}` + `GET /api/flows/runs/{run_id}/nodes` every 2 seconds while the run is active (`pending` or `running`). The modal shows a live progress bar (completed/total steps), per-step status badges with execution times, a pulsing "Live" indicator in the header, and a "remaining steps" counter. Polling stops automatically when the run reaches a terminal status (`completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`). The play button on the flows table shows a spinner during the brief API round-trip.

### 13.7 Stale Flow Cleanup

Source: `backend/flows/stale_flow_cleanup.py`. Periodically removes or marks stale flow runs (orphaned conversation threads, timed-out runs).

---

## 14. Scheduler & Triggers

### 14.1 Scheduled Events

Backed by the `ScheduledEvent` model and `ScheduledEventExecutor` (Source: `backend/scheduler/scheduler_service.py:1-30`). Supports:
- **Notifications** — smart reminders with contact resolution.
- **Conversations** — autonomous multi-turn AI-driven conversations, terminated by completion phrases (English + Portuguese list at `scheduler_service.py:32-41`).

Scheduled messages and tool-execution steps are handled by the Flows subsystem (see §13).

`backend/scheduler/worker.py` runs the periodic tick.

### 14.2 Scheduler Providers

Unified provider interface: `backend/agent/skills/scheduler/base.py`.

`SchedulerProviderType` enum (Source: `scheduler/base.py:19-23`): `flows`, `google_calendar`, `asana`.

Implementations:
- `backend/agent/skills/scheduler/flows_provider.py` — internal Flows/ScheduledEvent backend.
- `backend/agent/skills/scheduler/calendar_provider.py` — Google Calendar.
- `backend/agent/skills/scheduler/asana_provider.py` — Asana.

Event status values (`scheduler/base.py:27-32`): `scheduled`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `cancelled`, `failed`.

Provider selection is factory-driven: `backend/agent/skills/scheduler/factory.py` (reads `AgentSkillIntegration` rows, `factory.py:196`).

---

## 15. Channels

Tsushin's messaging transports are implemented as pluggable `ChannelAdapter` classes under `backend/channels/`. Each adapter implements a common contract: `start()`, `stop()`, `send_message()`, `health_check()`, and `validate_recipient()`. Adapters are registered in `backend/channels/registry.py` and used by `AgentRouter` for outbound delivery. Inbound handling is transport-specific (MCP bridges, bot watchers, webhook endpoints).

The base contract and shared types are defined at:
- `backend/channels/base.py` — abstract `ChannelAdapter`
- `backend/channels/types.py` — `SendResult`, `HealthResult` dataclasses

### 15.1 WhatsApp

**Source:** `backend/channels/whatsapp/adapter.py`

WhatsApp is delivered through a per-tenant containerized MCP bridge (Go-based WhatsApp bridge using whatsmeow). The backend never speaks the WhatsApp protocol directly — it proxies outbound messages to an MCP container that holds an authenticated WhatsApp session.

Adapter capability flags (`backend/channels/whatsapp/adapter.py:22-28`):

| Flag | Value |
|---|---|
| `channel_type` | `whatsapp` |
| `delivery_mode` | `pull` |
| `supports_threads` | false |
| `supports_reactions` | false |
| `supports_rich_formatting` | false |
| `supports_media` | true |
| `text_chunk_limit` | 4096 |

**MCP resolution flow** (`adapter.py:137-173`, `backend/services/whatsapp_binding_service.py`):
1. Resolve `Agent.whatsapp_integration_id` → `WhatsAppMCPInstance` row for the agent's dedicated bridge.
2. If no explicit binding exists, auto-resolve only when the tenant has exactly one unambiguous `instance_type == "agent"` WhatsApp instance.
3. If multiple candidate instances exist, the backend leaves the agent unbound and Graph/Studio surface that ambiguity instead of silently guessing.
4. Else fall back to the development default `http://127.0.0.1:8080/api`.

**Pre-send health gate** (`adapter.py:175-211`): Before each send the adapter hits `{mcp_api_url}/health` with a 5 s timeout. If the MCP reports `connected=false`, the send is refused to prevent queue buildup while the QR is not scanned.

**Recipient validation** (`adapter.py:123-135`): Accepts WhatsApp JIDs containing `@`, or phone numbers matching `^\+?\d{10,15}$`. Numeric IDs ≤10 digits without `+` (likely Telegram chat IDs) are explicitly blocked.

**Conversation delay** (humanization): `WHATSAPP_CONVERSATION_DELAY_SECONDS` env var (default `5.0` seconds). Source: `backend/settings.py:102-103`, env var `TSN_WHATSAPP_CONVERSATION_DELAY_SECONDS` (legacy `WHATSAPP_CONVERSATION_DELAY_SECONDS`). Stored per-instance in `whatsapp_conversation_delay_seconds` column (`backend/models.py:52`, Float default 5.0).

**Group and number filters** — stored on the MCP instance and on watcher records:
- System defaults: `Config.group_filters` / `Config.number_filters` (JSON lists) — `backend/models.py:19-20`.
- Per-trigger overrides: `trigger_group_filters`, `trigger_number_filters` (NULL = use system default) — `backend/models.py:342-343`.
- Per-instance filters: `group_filters`, `number_filters` on the MCP instance — `backend/models.py:2758-2759`.

**Health check** (`adapter.py:99-121`): Calls the MCP bridge's `/health` endpoint via `MCPSender.check_health()`, returning connected/disconnected with latency (ms).

**Runtime reconciliation** (`backend/services/mcp_container_manager.py`): before health-sensitive operations, the backend repairs stale MCP metadata from deterministic conventions and live container attrs. This includes recovering blank/stale `container_id` from `container_name`, normalizing `session_data_path` / `messages_db_path`, and restoring the canonical `mcp_api_url`. This is what prevents the legacy `Resource ID was not provided` failure when an old row has drifted from Docker state.

**WhatsApp MCP instance configuration reference** (Source: `models.py:2759-2773`):

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `is_group_handler` | Boolean | `false` | Only one instance per tenant should handle groups (prevents duplicate responses in multi-instance setups) |
| `group_filters` | JSON (nullable) | NULL | WhatsApp group names to monitor. Example: `["Support Group", "VIP Chat"]` |
| `number_filters` | JSON (nullable) | NULL | Phone number allowlist for DMs. Example: `["+5500000000001"]` |
| `group_keywords` | JSON (nullable) | NULL | Keywords that trigger bot responses in groups. Example: `["help", "bot", "support"]`. When set, the bot only responds to group messages containing these keywords. |
| `display_name` | String(100) (nullable) | NULL | Optional human-readable label for the instance (e.g., "Support Bot"). Shown in Hub UI; falls back to `phone_number` when NULL. |
| `dm_auto_mode` | Boolean | `true` | Auto-reply to direct messages from unknown senders. Disable to require contacts to be pre-registered. |
| `api_secret` | String(64) (nullable) | NULL | 32-byte hex-encoded token for cross-tenant MCP authentication (SSRF prevention) |
| `api_secret_created_at` | DateTime (nullable) | NULL | Timestamp for secret rotation tracking |

**E2E setup — WhatsApp channel (8-step guided wizard):**

The **WhatsApp Setup Wizard** (Hub → Communication → Setup Wizard) walks through the full configuration in 8 steps:

1. **Welcome** — overview of the setup process.
2. **Connect Phone** — enter an optional Instance Name (display label) and phone number, then scan the QR code. A bot contact is auto-created with the instance name.
3. **About You** — register yourself as a contact (name + phone + DM Trigger toggle). Pre-populates from your account name.
4. **DM Settings** — toggle Auto-Reply mode (Simple mode by default; Advanced reveals number allowlist).
5. **Group Settings** — toggle "Monitor all groups" or select specific groups (Advanced reveals keyword triggers).
6. **Contacts** — review auto-created contacts (bot + user) and add more manually.
7. **Bind Agent** — select which AI agent handles this WhatsApp number. Auto-creates ContactAgentMapping for user and bot contacts.
8. **All Done** — summary of all configured items with green/amber indicators.

The wizard can also be launched manually from the Hub Communication tab or auto-launches after the onboarding tour if no WhatsApp instances exist.

**Manual setup (alternative):**

1. Navigate to **Hub → Communication → WhatsApp** in the UI.
2. Click **Manual Setup** — provide a name and the WhatsApp phone number.
3. The system spawns a Docker container (`mcp-agent-tenant_{timestamp}_{id}`) on `tsushin-network`.
4. **Scan the QR code** — visible in the UI or via `docker logs <container_name> --tail=20`. The QR expires after ~60 seconds; refresh if needed.
5. Once authenticated, the instance status changes to `running` with `connected=true`.
6. **Configure filters** — set `group_filters`, `number_filters`, and `group_keywords` on the instance to control where the bot responds.
7. **Assign to an agent** — on the agent's Channels tab, set `whatsapp_integration_id` to point to this instance.
8. **Test** — send a message from the WhatsApp number; the bot should respond via the assigned agent.

**Hub QR recovery behavior:** the Hub QR modal now has three explicit states: `loading`, `ready`, and `degraded`. After repeated health failures or repeated empty QR polls, the UI stops the infinite spinner and offers recovery actions (`Restart`, `Reset Auth`, reopen QR). The same recovery flow exists for the compose-managed tester card.

**Graph + Studio consistency:** Graph View consumes `resolved_whatsapp_integration_id`, `whatsapp_binding_status`, and `whatsapp_binding_source` from `/api/v2/agents/graph-preview`. This allows Graph to show:
- solid edge for explicit binding
- dashed edge for resolved-default binding
- `WhatsApp Unassigned` warning node when the channel is enabled but ambiguous/unassigned

**Getting Started Checklist:** The Watcher dashboard displays a "Getting Started" widget tracking 5 setup milestones: Configure Agent, Connect Channel, Add Contacts, Test in Playground, Create Flow. It auto-hides when all items are complete and can be dismissed.

**Hub Integration Summary:** A compact status strip above the Hub tab bar shows connection counts for AI Providers, WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, and Webhooks at a glance.

**Settings Progressive Disclosure:** The Settings page groups cards into "Essential" (Organization, Team Members, System AI, Integrations) always visible, and "Advanced" collapsed by default.

#### 15.1.1 Migration: LID support (v0.6.0)

WhatsApp is rolling out **Linked Device IDs (LIDs)** — a new identifier format that replaces the historical phone-number-based JID for many participants (especially in group chats, where privacy rules now obscure direct phone numbers). v0.6.0 ships three coordinated changes so existing Tsushin tenants upgrading from 0.5.x don't lose contact continuity:

1. **Contact auto-linking** — when an inbound message arrives with a new LID, the adapter looks up the existing `Contact` row by phone number (if the phone number is still exposed) and attaches the LID as an alternate identifier on the contact's `ContactChannelMapping`. No manual merge required.
   Source: `backend/channels/whatsapp/adapter.py` + `backend/services/contact_service.py`.

2. **UserAgentSession fallback via phone number** — `UserAgentSession` lookups (used for per-contact default agent resolution) now try LID-keyed rows first, then fall back to phone-number-keyed rows. Sessions created before the migration keep working until they're rewritten on next contact, at which point they get upgraded to LID keys.
   Source: `backend/services/user_agent_session_service.py`.

3. **ContactAgentMapping dual-key lookup** — `ContactAgentMapping` resolution accepts either a LID or a phone-number key and returns the first match. This keeps slash-command permissions, default-agent assignments, and DM trigger rules pointing at the right contact even as WhatsApp phases in LIDs for groups.
   Source: `backend/services/contact_agent_mapping_service.py`.

**Operational notes:**
- No migration script is required — the upgrade is transparent. Existing contacts continue to work; LIDs are attached on the fly as they arrive.
- If you see a group member that Tsushin treats as a new contact after the upgrade (because WhatsApp switched them to LID-only exposure), open the contact modal and add the previous phone number as an alternate identifier. The bot will then recognize both.
- Sentinel audit events for WhatsApp continue to log the original raw identifier (LID or phone), so the audit trail survives the transition.

### 15.2 Telegram

**Source:** `backend/channels/telegram/adapter.py`

Wraps a `TelegramSender` (bot token holder) using the official Telegram Bot HTTP API. Watchers/lifecycle are managed externally by `backend/services/telegram_watcher_manager.py` and `backend/services/telegram_bot_service.py`.

Capability flags (`adapter.py:19-25`):
- `delivery_mode=pull`, `text_chunk_limit=4096`, `supports_rich_formatting=true`, `supports_media=true`.

**Recipient validation** (`adapter.py:102-110`): Strictly numeric chat ID; any non-digit recipient is blocked.

**Send behavior** (`adapter.py:44-84`): If `media_path` is provided, uses `send_photo` with the text as caption; otherwise `send_message`.

**Health check** (`adapter.py:86-100`): Calls the Telegram bot API `getMe` and reports the bot's `@username`. `ChannelHealthService` directly hits `https://api.telegram.org/bot{token}/getMe` as well (`channel_health_service.py:268-269`).

**Token storage**: Encrypted with Fernet using the Telegram per-workspace encryption key (`services/encryption_key_service.get_telegram_encryption_key`, `services/channel_health_service.py:451-466`). Stored on `TelegramBotInstance.bot_token_encrypted`.

**E2E setup — Telegram channel:**

1. Create a bot via **@BotFather** on Telegram — use `/newbot`, choose a name and username.
2. Copy the bot token (format: `123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11`).
3. Navigate to **Hub → Channels → Telegram** in the UI.
4. Click **Add Bot** — paste the bot token; the system validates by calling `getMe`.
5. Choose delivery mode: **Webhook** (recommended for production) or **Polling** (simpler, no public URL required).
6. If using webhook: provide the publicly accessible URL where Telegram will send updates.
7. **Assign to an agent** — on the agent's Channels tab, set `telegram_integration_id`.
8. **Test** — message the bot on Telegram; it should respond via the assigned agent.

### 15.3 Slack

**Source:** `backend/channels/slack/adapter.py`

Uses `slack_sdk.WebClient` for REST calls and supports Socket Mode or HTTP Events API for inbound (lifecycle managed externally).

Capability flags (`adapter.py:20-26`):
- `delivery_mode=push`, `supports_threads=true`, `supports_reactions=true`, `supports_rich_formatting=true` (Block Kit), `supports_media=true`, `text_chunk_limit=4000`.

**Send behavior** (`adapter.py:54-113`):
- Text: `chat_postMessage` with optional `thread_ts`.
- File: `files_upload_v2` with `initial_comment` and `thread_ts`.
- All blocking calls dispatched via `loop.run_in_executor` (slack_sdk is synchronous).

**Recipient validation** (`adapter.py:130-134`): First character must be `C` (channel), `G` (group), `D` (DM channel), `U` or `W` (user ID).

**Health check** (`adapter.py:115-128`): Calls `auth.test` and returns bot user + team name on success.

**Model:** `SlackIntegration` (`backend/models.py:2835`). Bot token is Fernet-encrypted per tenant (`services/encryption_key_service.get_slack_encryption_key`).

**OAuth & scopes:** Credentials and scope configuration are not enumerated in the adapter; Slack app installation produces a `xoxb-` bot token that is stored encrypted on the integration row. Not verified in source — refer to SlackIntegration model and OAuth install route for exact scopes.

**Slack access control configuration** (Source: `models.py:2867-2868`):

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dm_policy` | String(20) | `"allowlist"` | DM access policy: `open` (accept all DMs), `allowlist` (only respond in allowed channels), `disabled` (ignore all DMs) |
| `allowed_channels` | JSON | `[]` | List of Slack channel IDs the bot may respond in. Only used when `dm_policy=allowlist`. Example: `["C0123ABC", "C0456DEF"]` |

**E2E setup — Slack channel:**

1. **Create a Slack App** at [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) (the "From a manifest" option is the fastest way — Tsushin's recommended manifest enables Socket Mode and the bot scopes below in one shot):
   - Bot scopes: `app_mentions:read`, `channels:history`, `channels:read`, `chat:write`, `files:write`, `groups:history`, `im:history`, `im:read`, `im:write`, `mpim:history`, `users:read`.
   - Bot events: `app_mention`, `message.channels`, `message.groups`, `message.im`, `message.mpim`.
   - For **Socket Mode** (recommended): enable Socket Mode under Settings, then generate an **App-Level Token** with the `connections:write` scope (you'll get an `xapp-...` token).
   - For **HTTP Events API**: the Tsushin UI will show you the exact Request URL after you save the integration — paste that into Event Subscriptions → Request URL. Also copy the Signing Secret and App ID from Basic Information.
2. **Install the app** to your workspace — copy the `xoxb-` bot token from OAuth & Permissions.
3. (HTTP mode only) Configure your tenant's **Public Base URL** in Hub → Communication first — this is the publicly-reachable HTTPS URL Slack will POST to. Socket Mode does not need this.
4. Navigate to **Hub → Channels → Slack** in the UI.
5. Click **Connect Workspace** — paste the bot token plus the App-Level Token (Socket Mode) or the App ID + Signing Secret (HTTP mode). The modal will preview the exact webhook URL for HTTP mode.
6. Set `dm_policy` — `open` to accept all DMs, `allowlist` to restrict to specific channels, or `disabled`.
7. If using allowlist, add the Slack channel IDs where the bot should operate.
8. **Assign to an agent** — on the agent's Channels tab, enable the Slack channel and pick the workspace.
9. **Invite the bot** to your channel: `/invite @<bot name>` from inside Slack.
10. **Test** — message the bot in the allowed channel or DM; it should respond via the assigned agent. Replies in channel are auto-threaded under the original message (V060-CHN-031).

**How Socket Mode is wired (V060-CHN-002):** `SlackSocketModeManager` (in `backend/services/slack_socket_mode_manager.py`) is started by `app.py`'s lifespan and spins up one `slack_sdk.socket_mode.aiohttp.SocketModeClient` per active `mode='socket'` integration. The integration's create/update/delete endpoints in `routes_slack.py` call `restart_one()` / `stop_one()` so workers track integration state without a backend restart. The worker filters out non-message events and bot-authored messages, then enqueues the rest into `message_queue` (channel='slack'); the `QueueWorker._process_slack_message` dispatcher routes through `AgentRouter` and the bot replies via the existing `SlackChannelAdapter`.

### 15.4 Discord

**Source:** `backend/channels/discord/adapter.py`

Uses the Discord REST API v10 directly (`https://discord.com/api/v10`) via `aiohttp`. Gateway/intents are only needed for inbound events and are managed externally.

Capability flags (`adapter.py:27-33`):
- `delivery_mode=push`, `supports_threads=true`, `supports_reactions=true`, `supports_rich_formatting=true` (Markdown + Embeds), `supports_media=true`, `text_chunk_limit=2000`.

**Auth:** Bot token sent as `Authorization: Bot {token}` header (`adapter.py:50-55`).

**Send behavior** (`adapter.py:67-139`):
- Text: `POST /channels/{id}/messages` with `{"content": text}`. Supports `thread_id` via `message_reference`.
- Media: Multipart upload using `payload_json` + `files[0]`.

**Recipient validation** (`adapter.py:164-168`): Discord snowflake — 17-20 digit numeric string.

**Health check** (`adapter.py:141-162`): `GET /users/@me`.

**Model:** `DiscordIntegration` (`backend/models.py:2876`). Bot token Fernet-encrypted (`services/encryption_key_service.get_discord_encryption_key`).

**Discord access control configuration** (Source: `models.py:2904-2906`):

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dm_policy` | String(20) | `"allowlist"` | DM access policy: `open` (accept all DMs), `allowlist` (only respond in allowed guilds/channels), `disabled` (ignore all DMs) |
| `allowed_guilds` | JSON | `[]` | List of Discord guild (server) IDs the bot may operate in. Example: `["123456789012345678"]` |
| `guild_channel_config` | JSON | `{}` | Per-guild channel configuration — controls which channels within each guild the bot listens to. Example: `{"123456789012345678": {"channels": ["987654321098765432"]}}` |

**E2E setup — Discord channel:**

1. Configure your tenant's **Public Base URL** in Hub → Communication first. Discord requires a publicly-reachable HTTPS URL for the Interactions endpoint — there is no Socket Mode equivalent. For local dev, run `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8081` and paste the resulting `https://*.trycloudflare.com` URL.
2. **Create a Discord Application** at [discord.com/developers](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
3. On **General Information**: copy the **Application ID** and the **Public Key** (64-character hex Ed25519). Both are required by Tsushin.
4. Under **Bot**: reset and copy the bot token; enable **Message Content Intent** under Privileged Gateway Intents.
5. Under **OAuth2 → URL Generator**: select scopes `bot` + `applications.commands` and permissions `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`, `Attach Files`, `Read Messages/View Channels`. Use the generated URL to invite the bot to your server.
6. Navigate to **Hub → Channels → Discord** in the UI.
7. Click **Connect Bot** — paste the **Application ID**, **Bot Token**, and **Public Key**. The modal will preview the exact Interactions Endpoint URL after save.
8. Copy that URL and paste it into Discord Dev Portal → General Information → **Interactions Endpoint URL**, then click Save Changes. Discord PINGs the URL for verification — Tsushin handles the PING automatically with the per-integration public key (BUG-311 fix).
9. Set `dm_policy` and `allowed_guilds` to control where the bot responds.
10. **Assign to an agent** — on the agent's Channels tab, enable the Discord channel and pick the bot.
11. **Test** — DM the bot in Discord or invoke it from a server channel; it should respond via the assigned agent.

**Why HTTP Interactions, not Gateway:** Tsushin uses Discord's HTTP Interactions endpoint (Ed25519-signed) rather than the Gateway WebSocket because it's stateless, scales horizontally, and doesn't require per-process bot session tracking. Inbound interactions arrive at `/api/channels/discord/{integration_id}/interactions`; the route ACKs Discord with a Type 5 (deferred response) within the 3-second window, then enqueues the interaction into `message_queue` (channel='discord'). `QueueWorker._process_discord_message` routes the message through `AgentRouter` and the agent's reply is sent via `DiscordChannelAdapter` (REST API).

### 15.5 Webhook

**Source:** `backend/channels/webhook/adapter.py`

Bidirectional HTTP channel. Inbound: external systems POST HMAC-signed events to `/api/webhooks/{id}/inbound` (handled by `routes_webhook_inbound.py`, enqueued into `MessageQueue`, routed through `AgentRouter` by `QueueWorker._handle_webhook`). Outbound: the adapter POSTs agent responses back to the customer's `callback_url`.

Capability flags (`adapter.py:39-46`):
- `delivery_mode=push`, text-only in v1 (`supports_media=false`), `text_chunk_limit=16000`.

**Outbound callback POST** (`adapter.py:88-202`):
- Optional — governed by `integration.callback_enabled` + `integration.callback_url`. If disabled, the adapter reports success with `message_id="webhook_inbound_only"` (result pollable via `/api/v1/queue/{id}`).
- SSRF-validated via `utils/ssrf_validator.validate_url()` before the POST.
- Timeout: `10.0` seconds (`_CALLBACK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `adapter.py:33`).
- Response body capped at `65536` bytes (`_MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES`, `adapter.py:32`).
- `follow_redirects=False`.

**HMAC signing** (`adapter.py:134-157`):
- Canonical payload JSON (sorted keys, compact separators) includes: `event`, `webhook_id`, `timestamp`, `text`, `agent_id`, `sender_key`, `source_id`.
- Signature: `HMAC-SHA256(secret, f"{timestamp}.".bytes + body_bytes)` — replay-protected.
- Headers emitted: `X-Tsushin-Signature: sha256={hex}`, `X-Tsushin-Timestamp`, `X-Tsushin-Event`, `X-Tsushin-Webhook-Id`, `User-Agent: Tsushin-Webhook/1.0`.

**Secret encryption:** `api_secret_encrypted` decrypted via `TokenEncryption` keyed by the webhook encryption master key + per-tenant derivation (`adapter.py:71-86`, `services/encryption_key_service.get_webhook_encryption_key`).

**Health:** Uses stored snapshot from the `WebhookIntegration` row (`is_active`, `status`, `circuit_breaker_state`, `health_status`, `circuit_breaker_failure_count`) — no live probe to avoid amplification (`adapter.py:204-222`).

**Model:** `WebhookIntegration` (`backend/models.py:2918`).

**E2E setup — Webhook channel:**

1. Navigate to **Hub → Channels → Webhooks** in the UI.
2. Click **Add Integration** — provide a name and optionally a callback URL for outbound responses.
3. The system generates an HMAC signing secret (visible once, stored encrypted). **Copy and save it.**
4. Configure optional defenses: IP allowlist (CIDR ranges), rate limit (RPM), max payload size.
5. **Assign to an agent** — on the agent's Channels tab, set `webhook_integration_id`.
6. **Test inbound** — send a signed event to your webhook:

```bash
# Generate HMAC signature
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%s)
BODY='{"text":"Hello from webhook","sender_key":"external-user-1"}'
SIGNATURE=$(echo -n "${TIMESTAMP}.${BODY}" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "<your_api_secret>" | awk '{print $2}')

# Send inbound event
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/webhooks/<webhook_id>/inbound \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Tsushin-Signature: sha256=${SIGNATURE}" \
  -H "X-Tsushin-Timestamp: ${TIMESTAMP}" \
  -d "${BODY}"
```

7. If `callback_url` is configured, the agent's response will be POSTed there with HMAC-signed headers.

### 15.6 Playground

**Source:** `backend/channels/playground/adapter.py`

The web Playground is request/response (API + WebSocket streaming) — responses are delivered synchronously via `PlaygroundService` and the adapter's `send_message` is a no-op success (`adapter.py:39-50`).

Capability flags (`adapter.py:20-26`):
- `delivery_mode=push`, `supports_threads=true`, `supports_rich_formatting=true`, `supports_media=true`, `text_chunk_limit=65536`.

**Health:** Always healthy — no external connection (`adapter.py:52-54`).

Underlying services:
- `backend/services/playground_service.py`
- `backend/services/playground_websocket_service.py`
- `backend/services/playground_thread_service.py`
- `backend/services/playground_message_service.py`
- `backend/services/playground_document_service.py`

### 15.7 Channel Health Monitoring & Circuit Breakers

**Source:** `backend/services/channel_health_service.py`, `backend/services/circuit_breaker.py`

`ChannelHealthService` is a background asyncio task that periodically probes every active WhatsApp/Telegram/Slack/Discord instance and transitions a per-instance circuit breaker across `CLOSED` → `OPEN` → `HALF_OPEN` → `CLOSED`.

**Configuration (env vars)** — `backend/settings.py:204-207`:

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `TSN_CHANNEL_HEALTH_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable the background monitor |
| `TSN_CHANNEL_HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL` | `30` (seconds) | Probe interval |
| `TSN_CHANNEL_CB_FAILURE_THRESHOLD` | `3` | Consecutive failures to trip CB to OPEN |
| `TSN_CHANNEL_CB_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT` | `60` (seconds) | OPEN → HALF_OPEN cooldown |

**Per-channel probe logic** (`channel_health_service.py:187-445`):
- WhatsApp: delegates to `MCPContainerManager.health_check(instance)`; healthy if `status` ∈ {healthy, degraded} AND `connected=True`.
- Telegram: calls `api.telegram.org/bot{token}/getMe` with 10 s timeout.
- Slack: constructs `SlackChannelAdapter` and calls its `health_check` (`auth.test`).
- Discord: constructs `DiscordChannelAdapter` and calls `/users/@me`.

**State-transition side effects** (`_handle_transition`, `channel_health_service.py:519-611`):
1. Emit Prometheus counters (`TSN_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TRANSITIONS_TOTAL`) and gauge (`TSN_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_STATE`, CLOSED=0, OPEN=1, HALF_OPEN=2).
2. Persist a `ChannelHealthEvent` row (isolated DB session).
3. Emit WebSocket event via `WatcherActivityService.emit_channel_health`.
4. If transition is to OPEN, dispatch an alert via `ChannelAlertDispatcher`.

**Admin overrides** (`channel_health_service.py:775-799`): `reset_circuit_breaker()` forces CLOSED, `on_external_recovery()` jumps to HALF_OPEN, `manual_probe()` triggers an immediate probe.

Dispatcher for channel alerts: `backend/services/channel_alert_dispatcher.py`.

## 16. Contacts & Channel Mapping

### 16.1 Contact Form Fields

Source: `frontend/app/agents/contacts/page.tsx:17-52` (form interface), `:97-194` (handlers). DB: `backend/models.py:144-181`.

| Field | Type | DB column |
|---|---|---|
| `friendly_name` | text, required | `friendly_name` (`:155`) |
| `phone_number` | text | `phone_number` (deprecated — prefer channel_mappings) (`:157`) |
| `telegram_id` | text | `telegram_id` (deprecated) (`:160`) |
| `telegram_username` | text | `telegram_username` (deprecated) (`:161`) |
| `role` | `user` \| `agent` \| `external` | `role` (default `user`) (`:163`) |
| `is_dm_trigger` | Boolean, default true | `is_dm_trigger` (`:165`) |
| `slash_commands_enabled` | tri-state (null\|true\|false) | `slash_commands_enabled` (NULL=use tenant default) (`:166`) |
| `notes` | textarea | `notes` (`:167`) |
| `linked_user_id` | select | FK to User (linking contact to a tenant user account). |
| `default_agent_id` | select | Persisted as `ContactAgentMapping` row (see `:167-182`). |

Unique constraint: `(friendly_name, tenant_id)` (`models.py:180`).

### 16.2 ContactChannelMapping

Universal mapping table for multi-channel identifiers (Source: `models.py:184-219`).

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `contact_id` | FK Contact. |
| `channel_type` | `whatsapp`, `telegram`, `phone`, `discord`, `email`, … |
| `channel_identifier` | The primary channel ID (phone, user_id, email…). |
| `channel_metadata` (JSON) | e.g. `{username: "@johndoe", display_name: "John Doe"}`. |
| `tenant_id` | Tenant isolation. |

Uniqueness: `(channel_type, channel_identifier, tenant_id)` (`:213-214`). One contact can hold multiple mappings across channels.

Service: `backend/services/contact_channel_mapping_service.py`. Auto-population (e.g., WhatsApp ID discovery): `backend/services/contact_auto_populate_service.py`, `backend/services/whatsapp_id_discovery.py`. Contact resolution for group senders: `backend/services/group_sender_resolver.py`.

### 16.3 Slash Command Access Control

Two-level policy (tenant default + per-contact override):
- **Tenant default** — set in `Config` table (tenant-level); used when contact override is NULL.
- **Per-contact override** — `Contact.slash_commands_enabled` (NULL/True/False) (Source: `models.py:166`).

Enforcement logic: `backend/services/slash_command_permission_service.py` (referenced under `backend/services/`). Available slash commands are defined in `backend/services/slash_command_service.py` and related `*_command_service.py` modules.

### 16.4 Usage Examples

**Create a contact with multi-channel mapping:**

```bash
# Create the contact
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/contacts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "friendly_name": "John Doe",
    "role": "user",
    "is_dm_trigger": true,
    "slash_commands_enabled": true,
    "notes": "VIP customer, priority support"
  }'

# Add WhatsApp channel mapping
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/contacts/<contact_id>/channel-mappings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"channel_type": "whatsapp", "channel_identifier": "+5511999990001"}'

# Add Telegram channel mapping
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/contacts/<contact_id>/channel-mappings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"channel_type": "telegram", "channel_identifier": "123456789"}'
```

**Link a contact to a system user account:**

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8081/api/contacts/<contact_id> \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"linked_user_id": 5}'
```

When a contact is linked to a system user, messages from that contact inherit the user's RBAC permissions and audit trail.

**Assign a default agent per contact:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/contacts/<contact_id>/agent-mapping \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agent_id": 3}'
```

This ensures messages from this contact are always routed to the specified agent, overriding the tenant's default agent.

## 17. Projects (Studio)

Projects are tenant-wide isolated workspaces with dedicated KBs, memory, and tool configurations. Since Phase 15 they are no longer user-scoped.

DB: `backend/models.py:1024-1082`. UI: `frontend/app/agents/projects/page.tsx`, detail at `frontend/app/agents/projects/[id]/page.tsx`. API: `backend/api/routes_projects.py`.

### 17.1 Project Form

Source: `frontend/app/agents/projects/page.tsx:92-108`.

| Field | Type | Default | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | text, required | — | `models.py:1042` |
| `description` | text | — | `models.py:1043` |
| `icon` | select | `"folder"` | 12 icon options at `:44-57` |
| `color` | select | `"blue"` | 7 color options at `:33-41` |
| `agent_id` | select | NULL | Default agent for project — `models.py:1046` |
| `system_prompt_override` | text | NULL | Custom instructions — `models.py:1049` |

### 17.2 Knowledge Base Config (per project)

Source: `backend/models.py:1062-1065`, UI at `page.tsx:99-101, 65-77`.

| Field | Default | Options |
|---|---|---|
| `kb_chunk_size` | 500 (chars) | integer |
| `kb_chunk_overlap` | 50 (chars) | integer |
| `kb_embedding_model` | `"all-MiniLM-L6-v2"` | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, `all-mpnet-base-v2`, `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`, `text-embedding-3-small`, `text-embedding-3-large`, `text-embedding-ada-002`, `text-embedding-004`, `embedding-001` |

Embedding model list: `frontend/app/agents/projects/page.tsx:65-77`.

### 17.3 Memory Config (per project)

Source: `backend/models.py:1067-1072`.

| Field | Default |
|---|---|
| `enable_semantic_memory` | True |
| `semantic_memory_results` | 10 |
| `semantic_similarity_threshold` | 0.5 |
| `enable_factual_memory` | True |
| `factual_extraction_threshold` | 5 (messages before fact extraction) |

### 17.4 Enabled Tools

- `enabled_tools` (JSON) — built-in tool IDs (`models.py:1050`).
- `enabled_sandboxed_tools` (JSON, alias `enabled_custom_tools`) — sandboxed tool IDs (`models.py:1051-1060`).
- `is_archived` — archive flag (`models.py:1075`).

Project command patterns are exposed via `backend/services/project_command_service.py`.

Per-project documents live in `project_knowledge` (`models.py:1085-1103`) with fields: `document_name`, `document_type`, `file_path`, `file_size_bytes`, `num_chunks`, `status` (`pending|processing|completed|failed`), `error_message`, `upload_date`, `processed_date`. Memory: `backend/services/project_memory_service.py`.

---

## 18. Playground

Web-based chat UI for testing/interacting with agents. UI: `frontend/app/playground/page.tsx`. Backend: `backend/api/routes_playground.py`, services under `backend/services/playground_*.py`.

### 18.1 Thread Management

Threads managed by `backend/services/playground_thread_service.py`. Each thread holds a message history and belongs to a tenant/user. Auto-rename is supported and emitted over WebSocket (`frontend/app/playground/page.tsx:142, :178`).

The Playground history and memory endpoints accept an optional `thread_id` so reads use the same identity contract as writes:
- `isolated` → per-thread memory
- `channel_isolated` → shared memory across Playground threads in the same channel, but thread-scoped history display
- `shared` → per-agent global memory across Playground threads

### 18.2 Audio Recording & Whisper Transcription

The page uses `MediaRecorder` to capture voice directly in the browser (`page.tsx:498-518`):
- Preferred MIME types (in order): `audio/webm;codecs=opus`, `audio/webm`, `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`, `audio/mp4` (`:502-510`).
- Audio capabilities are loaded per selected agent (`:484-490`) — determined by the agent's configured `audio_transcript` skill.

Transcription is performed by the `audio_transcript` skill (Source: `backend/agent/skills/audio_transcript.py`) using OpenAI Whisper or configured provider. Skill is `execution_mode="special"` (media-triggered).

### 18.3 Document Uploads

Supported extensions (Source: `backend/services/playground_document_service.py:32-38`):
- `.pdf` → pdf
- `.txt` → txt
- `.csv` → csv
- `.json` → json
- `.xlsx` / `.xls` → xlsx
- `.docx` / `.doc` → docx
- `.md` / `.markdown` → md
- `.rtf` → rtf

The Playground "Attach documents" flow is document-only. Images and other unsupported file types are rejected by both the frontend chooser and the backend validation layer with an explicit supported-types error message. Maximum file size is 10 MB per document.

Handling lives in `playground_document_service.py` and `playground_message_service.py`.

### 18.4 UI Features

- **Expert mode** — advanced controls visible on the page.
- **Command palette** — quick slash-command entry.
- **Knowledge panel** — surfaces relevant KB chunks used to answer.
- **Memory inspector** — inspect which memory layer entries were pulled (backed by `MemoryManagementService`).

(These UI panels are toggled within `frontend/app/playground/page.tsx`; exact field names not enumerated here — recommend confirmation by opening the file in UI if precise toggle names are needed.)

### 18.5 Token Streaming (WebSocket)

Source: `frontend/app/playground/page.tsx:98-232`, `backend/services/playground_websocket_service.py`.

- Client hook: `usePlaygroundWebSocket` (`:21`, `:131-232`).
- Cookie-based auth (no localStorage token) — "SEC-005" note.
- Events: `onQueueProcessingStarted`, `onQueueMessageCompleted`, thread-auto-rename, token streaming.
- Feature-flagged via `useWebSocket` state (default true, `:99`).

Backend WebSocket handler: `backend/services/playground_websocket_service.py`. Fallback to HTTP polling when WS disabled.

### 18.6 Async Queuing & Dead-Letter Retry

Service layer: `backend/services/message_queue_service.py`, `backend/services/queue_worker.py`.

- Messages submitted via the async path receive a `queue_id`.
- Placeholder messages render in UI with `message_id = "queue_{id}"` (`page.tsx:193, 205, 232`).
- On completion, `onQueueMessageCompleted` replaces the placeholder with the real response and triggers a thread refresh.
- Dead-letter retry is handled server-side by the queue worker on failed jobs.

## 19. LLM Providers

**Sources:**
- `backend/services/provider_instance_service.py` — CRUD/encryption/SSRF
- `backend/api/routes_provider_instances.py` — REST endpoints
- `backend/services/model_discovery_service.py` — model auto-fetch
- `backend/api/routes_model_pricing.py` — pricing endpoints
- `frontend/app/settings/model-pricing/page.tsx` — pricing UI

### 19.1 Provider Instance Model

Each tenant may configure **multiple provider instances** (e.g., two OpenAI accounts, a self-hosted Ollama + a hosted Groq). Each instance holds:

| Field | Purpose | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `vendor` | Provider key (see matrix below) | `provider_instance_service.py:20-32` |
| `instance_name` | Display name (unique per tenant+vendor) | `create_instance` args |
| `base_url` | Override vendor default; SSRF-validated before save | `provider_instance_service.py:110-118` |
| `api_key` | Fernet-encrypted via `TokenEncryption` + per-tenant derivation | `create_instance` (encrypt path) |
| `available_models` | JSON list of model IDs exposed for use | `create_instance` args |
| `is_default` | Only one default per (tenant, vendor) enforced | `create_instance` |
| `is_active` | Soft disable | list filters |

Encryption uses the same pattern as `api_key_service.py` — `TokenEncryption` keyed by the master encryption key from `services/encryption_key_service.py`.

During first-run setup, the `/setup` wizard can create multiple provider instances in one pass. Every supported provider key entered in the wizard is provisioned as its own tenant-scoped instance, and the selected primary provider is also written to the system-AI configuration.

### 19.2 Provider Matrix

From `backend/services/provider_instance_service.py:20-32`:

| Vendor key | Default `base_url` | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `openai` | None (SDK default) | Standard OpenAI API |
| `anthropic` | None (SDK default) | Anthropic Claude API |
| `gemini` | None (SDK default) | Google Generative AI |
| `groq` | `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1` | OpenAI-compatible |
| `grok` | `https://api.x.ai/v1` | xAI, OpenAI-compatible |
| `deepseek` | `https://api.deepseek.com/v1` | OpenAI-compatible |
| `openrouter` | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` | Router / multi-vendor |
| `ollama` | `http://host.docker.internal:11434` | Local LLM server; `validate_ollama_url` SSRF guard |
| `vertex_ai` | None | Region-resolved from credentials |
| `custom` | Free-form (SSRF-validated) | Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |

An Ollama default is auto-provisioned per tenant on demand via `ensure_ollama_instance()` (`provider_instance_service.py:37-65`), seeded from `Config.ollama_base_url` or the default. In Docker-on-Linux VM setups, `host.docker.internal` is the preferred endpoint; if that hostname is unavailable on the target host, point the provider instance at the Docker bridge gateway IP instead and retest from the Hub UI.

### 19.3 Dynamic Provider & Model Dropdowns

All agent creation and configuration UIs — the `/agents` Create Agent modal, the Studio `+` button (`StudioAgentSelector`), `AgentConfigurationManager`, and the Playground config panel — fetch the provider list **at runtime** from `GET /api/provider-instances`. The dropdown shows only vendors that have at least one active instance configured in Hub > AI Providers. Models shown for each vendor come from that instance's `available_models` list (set during hub configuration or model discovery).

This means: adding a new provider in Hub automatically makes it available everywhere without any code change. The shared `VENDOR_LABELS` map (`frontend/lib/client.ts`) provides human-readable vendor names.

### 19.4 Model Discovery

`backend/services/model_discovery_service.py` auto-fetches the vendor's `/models` endpoint (for OpenAI-compatible providers) and populates `available_models`. Used by the frontend Provider form to let the user pick which models to expose.

### 19.5 Model Pricing

**Source:** `frontend/app/settings/model-pricing/page.tsx`, `backend/api/routes_model_pricing.py`

Pricing rates per 1M tokens used for cost estimation in the Playground debug panel. Defaults are based on official provider pricing; tenant-set custom rates override defaults.

UI table columns (`model-pricing/page.tsx:326-347`):
- Model (with provider badge, display name, raw model name)
- Input cost per 1M tokens (numeric input, step=0.001)
- Output cost per 1M tokens (numeric input, step=0.001)
- Status
- Actions (Edit / Save)

Filters: "All" or a provider badge filter (`page.tsx:292-323`). Tenants without `org.settings.write` see read-only mode (gate at top of file).

### 19.6 Anthropic Prompt Caching — v0.6.0

v0.6.0 enables Anthropic's **prompt caching** across all Claude requests. Caching reuses Anthropic-side computation of stable prompt prefixes (system prompt, persona, skill instructions, knowledge snippets) across subsequent requests, so the LLM only re-processes the dynamic tail of the conversation. Tenants with chat-heavy workloads see a **40–65% reduction in input token cost** with no behavioral change.

**How it works (3 breakpoints + relocation trick):**

Anthropic supports up to four `cache_control` breakpoints per request. Tsushin uses three, strategically placed to maximize hit rate:

| # | Position | Cached content | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | End of system prompt | Persona, tone preset, agent rules, skill catalog | Stable across every turn of the same agent |
| 2 | End of tool definitions block | MCP schemas, sandboxed tool defs, custom skill descriptors | Changes only when skills are added/removed |
| 3 | Just before the current user turn | Conversation history + any retrieved-knowledge context | The "relocation trick" — cache point moves forward as the conversation grows, so each prior turn gets cached on its way past breakpoint 3 |

**Default Anthropic model:** `claude-haiku-4-5` (v0.6.0 bump). The default is set in `backend/services/provider_instance_service.py` and surfaces in the agent Create modal under Hub → AI Providers → Anthropic → Default Model. Override per-agent in the agent config UI.

**Sources:**
- `backend/providers/anthropic_provider.py` — breakpoint placement and `cache_control` injection
- `backend/services/token_tracker.py` — cache-hit accounting in the Watcher billing dashboard

**Requirements & caveats:**
- Requires Anthropic API access with prompt caching enabled (on by default for all Anthropic accounts in 2025+).
- Cache hits appear in the Playground debug panel and in `/api/usage` token summaries under `cache_read_input_tokens` / `cache_creation_input_tokens`.
- Cache TTL is Anthropic-managed (5 minutes idle, or evicted under load). Tsushin does not persist anything client-side.
- No configuration is required — it's always on for Anthropic requests. To disable for a specific agent (rare — e.g., if you want to rehearse a cold token count), set `provider_config.cache_enabled = false` in the agent config JSON.

## 20. Hub Integrations

**Sources:** `backend/hub/`, `backend/hub/providers/`, `backend/hub/oauth_token_refresh_worker.py`, `frontend/app/hub/page.tsx`.

### 20.1 Google (Calendar, Gmail)

**Sources:** `backend/hub/google/oauth_handler.py`, `backend/hub/google/calendar_service.py`, `backend/hub/google/gmail_service.py`

- OAuth2 installed-app flow (redirect URI pattern documented in `oauth_handler.py`).
- Models: `GmailIntegration` (`models.py:3021`), `CalendarIntegration` (`models.py:3061`) — both subclass `HubIntegration`.
- Tokens encrypted with the Google encryption key (`encryption_key_service.get_google_encryption_key`).
- Google SSO credentials (`client_id`, `client_secret`) are stored under `Settings → Security & SSO` (see §21.5) and reused for both Gmail/Calendar integrations and user sign-in.

### 20.2 Asana (OAuth + MCP)

**Sources:** `backend/hub/asana/asana_service.py`, `backend/hub/asana/asana_mcp_client.py`, `backend/hub/asana/oauth_handler.py`

- OAuth2 code flow → `AsanaIntegration` (`models.py:1851`).
- MCP client (`asana_mcp_client.py`) speaks MCP protocol to Asana's hosted MCP server to list projects, tasks, and members.
- Tokens encrypted with the Hub encryption key.

### 20.3 Amadeus (flight search)

**Source:** `backend/hub/amadeus/amadeus_service.py`, `backend/hub/providers/amadeus_provider.py`
Model: `AmadeusIntegration` (`models.py:1881`). Holds Amadeus API key+secret (encrypted) and talks to the Amadeus test/production API for flight offers.

### 20.4 Brave Search / SerpAPI / Google Flights

**Sources:** `backend/hub/providers/brave_search_provider.py`, `backend/hub/providers/serpapi_search_provider.py`, `backend/hub/providers/google_flights_provider.py`, `backend/hub/providers/search_registry.py`, `backend/hub/providers/flight_search_provider.py`

- Brave Search: API key based web search provider (primary supported search provider in v0.6.0).
- SerpAPI: used for both generic web search and Google Flights (Google Flights falls back to env var `SERPAPI_KEY` or `GOOGLE_FLIGHTS_API_KEY` — `google_flights_provider.py:71-74`).
- All search providers register with `SearchRegistry` and are configured through the Hub page (`GoogleFlightsIntegration` — `models.py:3108`).
- **Tavily:** Not supported in v0.6.0. Planned for a future release. If you need a search provider, use Brave Search.

### 20.5 Browser Automation (Playwright, CDP)

**Sources:** `backend/hub/providers/browser_automation_provider.py`, `backend/hub/providers/playwright_provider.py`, `backend/hub/providers/cdp_provider.py`, `backend/hub/providers/browser_session_manager.py`, `backend/hub/providers/browser_automation_registry.py`
Model: `BrowserAutomationIntegration` (`models.py:3136`).

Two provider types (`browser_automation_provider.py:196-252`):

| Provider | `provider_type` | Config |
|---|---|---|
| Playwright (in-container) | `playwright` | Launches Chromium inside the backend container |
| CDP (host browser) | `cdp` | Connects over CDP to a running Chrome on the host; default `cdp_url=http://host.docker.internal:9222` |

The CDP provider validates the CDP URL through `utils/cdp_url_validator.validate_cdp_url` before connecting (`cdp_provider.py:66-72`) and persists browser state (cookies, localStorage, active logins) via the live CDP connection.

### 20.6 TTS (Kokoro, OpenAI, ElevenLabs)

**Sources:** `backend/hub/providers/tts_provider.py` (abstract + `TTSRequest`/`TTSResponse`/`VoiceInfo`), `backend/hub/providers/kokoro_tts_provider.py`, `backend/hub/providers/openai_tts_provider.py`, `backend/hub/providers/elevenlabs_tts_provider.py`, `backend/hub/providers/tts_registry.py`, `backend/api/routes_tts_providers.py`

- Providers expose `get_available_voices()` → `List[VoiceInfo]` and a default voice.
- OpenAI TTS default voice: `"nova"` (`tts_provider.py:43`).
- Kokoro is a local/self-hosted TTS option (see `KOKORO_TTS_FIX.md`).

### 20.7 MCP Server Registration

**Sources:** `backend/hub/mcp/connection_manager.py`, `backend/hub/mcp/sse_transport.py`, `backend/hub/mcp/stdio_transport.py`, `backend/hub/mcp/transport_base.py`, `backend/hub/mcp/utils.py`
Custom third-party MCP servers can be registered via stdio or SSE transports. The `connection_manager` maintains the active MCP client sessions and exposes them to agent skills.

**Stdio transport toolbox bootstrap (BUG-512, 2026-04-10):** stdio MCP servers run their binary inside the tenant's toolbox container. `MCPConnectionManager.get_or_connect` now calls `ToolboxContainerService.ensure_container_running(tenant_id, db)` before constructing a stdio transport, so first-time `POST /api/mcp-servers/{id}/test` calls and first-time runtime invocations create or start the toolbox container on demand. Prior to this, fresh installs would error with `Container not found for tenant ... Please start it first` because there was no first-class UI action to bootstrap the toolbox. SSE and streamable_http transports are unaffected.

### 20.7.1 MCP Server Creation Wizard

After creating a new MCP server in Hub > MCP Servers, a 3-step wizard (`frontend/components/mcp/MCPServerWizard.tsx`) guides users through:

1. **Success + Tool Discovery** — shows server name, connection status, and discovered tools list
2. **Create Custom Skill** — pre-populates a custom skill form with the MCP server and selected tool; user can customize name and description
3. **Assign to Agents** — lists active agents with checkboxes to assign the new custom skill

Each step is skippable. The wizard eliminates the need to navigate between Hub > MCP Servers, Studio > Custom Skills, and Studio > Agent > Custom Skills tabs.

### 20.8 OAuth Token Refresh Worker

**Source:** `backend/hub/oauth_token_refresh_worker.py`

A background worker that polls all OAuth-backed integrations (Google, Asana, etc.) and refreshes access tokens before expiry.

**Env var configuration** — `backend/settings.py:111-120`:

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `TSN_OAUTH_REFRESH_POLL_MINUTES` | `30` | Poll interval in minutes |
| `TSN_OAUTH_REFRESH_THRESHOLD_HOURS` | `24` | Refresh tokens expiring within this window |
| `TSN_OAUTH_REFRESH_MAX_RETRIES` | `3` | Per-token refresh retry count |
| `TSN_OAUTH_REFRESH_RETRY_DELAY` | `5` (seconds) | Base exponential backoff |

---

## 21. Settings — UI Taxonomy

All subpages live at `frontend/app/settings/<subpage>/page.tsx`. Directory confirmed by listing `frontend/app/settings/`. The index page is `frontend/app/settings/page.tsx`.

### 21.1 Organization (`frontend/app/settings/organization/page.tsx`)

**Purpose:** View and edit tenant-level identity and plan information.

| Field | Type | Source line |
|---|---|---|
| Organization Name | Input (editable by org.settings.write) | `organization/page.tsx:196` |
| Organization Slug | Input | `organization/page.tsx:204` |
| Organization ID | Input (read-only display) | `organization/page.tsx:212` |
| Status | Label (e.g., active/suspended) | `organization/page.tsx:219` |

Sections:
- "Basic Information" (`:192`)
- "Plan & Limits" (`:234`) — shows current plan
- "Usage This Month" (`:256`)
- "Save Changes" button (`:282`)

### 21.2 Team Members (`frontend/app/settings/team/`)

Subroutes:
- `team/page.tsx` — member list with search (`placeholder="Search by name or email..."`, `:250`)
- `team/invite/page.tsx` — invite form:
  - **Email Address** input — `team/invite/page.tsx:171` (`placeholder="colleague@example.com"`, `:176`)
  - **Personal message** textarea (`placeholder="Add a personal message to the invitation email..."`, `:226`)
- `team/[id]/` — per-member detail view

### 21.3 Roles & Permissions (`frontend/app/settings/roles/page.tsx`)

Lists system and tenant-defined roles with display names and permission badges. Read-heavy page — permissions are rendered per-role with description blocks.

### 21.4 Integrations (`frontend/app/settings/integrations/page.tsx`)

**Purpose:** Tenant-level OAuth credentials (Client ID / Client Secret) for third-party providers. Currently houses the Google OAuth credentials panel.

| Field | Type | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Google — Client ID | Input (`placeholder="xxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com"`) | `integrations/page.tsx:315` |
| Google — Client Secret | Password input (`placeholder="GOCSPX-xxxxx"` or "(leave blank to keep current)") | `integrations/page.tsx:323` |
| Client ID (display) | Read-only display of saved value | `integrations/page.tsx:200` |
| Client Secret (display) | Masked | `integrations/page.tsx:206` |

"Coming Soon" section (`:277`) lists planned integrations. Removing Google credentials warns that it will disconnect all Google integrations (Gmail, Calendar) and disable Google SSO (`:79`).

### 21.5 Security & SSO (`frontend/app/settings/security/page.tsx`)

Three sections:

**Google Sign-In Policy:**

| Field | Type | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Enable Google Sign-In | Toggle | `security/page.tsx:326-339` |
| Allowed Email Domains | Comma-separated input (`placeholder="example.com, company.org"`) | `security/page.tsx:356-366` |
| Auto-provision new users | Toggle | `security/page.tsx:382-395` |
| Default Role for New Users | Select (only visible when auto-provision ON) | `security/page.tsx:417-433` |

**Encryption Keys** (`security/page.tsx:459-`):

| Field | Purpose | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Google Encryption Key | Fernet key for Google OAuth tokens (Gmail, Calendar) | `security/page.tsx:491-522` |
| Hub Encryption Key | Fernet key for Asana, Amadeus, Telegram tokens | `security/page.tsx:527-559` |

Each key field has a show/hide eye toggle and placeholder `"Enter Fernet encryption key"`. Helper text includes the generation command: `python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"` (`:471`).

### 21.6 Billing & Plans (`frontend/app/settings/billing/page.tsx`)

360-line page displaying the current plan, usage breakdown, and upgrade/downgrade options. No form inputs inventoried in the grep pass — the page is primarily read-only with plan-tier cards and action buttons.

### 21.7 Audit Logs (`frontend/app/settings/audit-logs/page.tsx`)

**Filters** (select dropdowns, `audit-logs/page.tsx:39-66`):

| Filter | Options |
|---|---|
| Action | All Actions, Authentication, Agents, Flows, Contacts, Settings, Security, API Clients, Custom Skills, MCP Servers, Team |
| Severity | All Severities, Info, Warning, Critical |
| Channel | All Channels, Web, API, WhatsApp, Telegram, System |
| From / To | Date range |

**Syslog Forwarding Panel** (`audit-logs/page.tsx:416-521`):

| Field | Type | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Host | Input (`placeholder="logs.example.com"`) | `:416-424` |
| Port | Numeric input | `:426-437` |
| Protocol | Select: UDP / TCP / TLS | `:439-449` |
| Facility | Select: User-level (1), Auth (4), Auth-priv (10), Audit (13), Local0–7 (16-23) | `:451-460` |
| App Name | Input (`placeholder="tsushin"`) | `:463-470` |
| TLS CA Certificate | Textarea (PEM) | `:487-495` |
| Event Categories | Checkbox list (per-category filter) | `:513-521` |

CSV export, retention config, and searchable event log are rendered in the main body.

### 21.8 Model Pricing (`frontend/app/settings/model-pricing/page.tsx`)

See §19.4.

### 21.9 System AI (`frontend/app/settings/ai-configuration/page.tsx`)

**Note:** `frontend/app/settings/system-ai/page.tsx` is a 5-line stub; the actual system AI configuration lives at `frontend/app/settings/ai-configuration/page.tsx`.

**Purpose:** Select the AI provider instance and model used by system-level features (Sentinel, memory extraction, skill classification, etc.).

The System AI config now points to an existing **Provider Instance** (managed in the Hub) instead of maintaining its own duplicated provider/model lists. The `Config` table stores `system_ai_provider_instance_id` (FK to `provider_instance`) alongside the model name.

UI flow:
- "Select Provider Instance" — card grid of active Provider Instances showing vendor icon, instance name, health dot, model count, and default badge. Managed via the Hub link.
- "Select Model" — list of models from the selected instance's `available_models`. If the instance has no discovered models, a manual text input is shown.
- "Test Connection" — sends a test message via the selected instance + model.
- Saves `{provider_instance_id, model_name}` to system config.

Backend resolution (`services/system_ai_config.py`): When `system_ai_provider_instance_id` is set, the vendor is resolved from the ProviderInstance and the AIClient receives the `provider_instance_id` for proper API key/base URL resolution. Falls back to legacy `system_ai_provider`/`system_ai_model` columns when no instance is linked.

### 21.10 Vector Stores (`frontend/app/settings/vector-stores/page.tsx`)

**Purpose:** Select the tenant's default vector store instance for agent long-term memory.

| Field | Type | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Default Vector Store | Select (options: `ChromaDB (built-in)` default, then per-instance `name (vendor)` entries with `- Provisioned` suffix for auto-provisioned) | `vector-stores/page.tsx:123-140` |

Supported vendors (label map, `:8-12`): `mongodb → MongoDB`, `pinecone → Pinecone`, `qdrant → Qdrant`.

Actions: **Save**, **Test** (connection probe returns `{success, message}` via `api.testVectorStoreConnection`).

Fresh setup now attempts to create `Qdrant (Default)` through the shared vector-store provisioning helper. If provisioning fails (for example image pull or runtime startup issues), setup completes with a warning and the operator can repair or recreate the instance later from **Settings → Vector Stores**.

Agents can override the default in the Agent Builder.

### 21.11 Prompts & Patterns (`frontend/app/settings/prompts/page.tsx`)

Four tabs (`prompts/page.tsx:70-88`):

| Tab | Label | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Global Config | Tenant-wide prompt configuration |
| 2 | Tone Presets | Manage tone presets (seeded via `backend/services/tone_preset_seeding.py`) |
| 3 | Slash Commands | Tenant custom slash commands (see §26) |
| 4 | Project Patterns | Project-matching patterns |

### 21.12 Sentinel Security (`frontend/app/settings/sentinel/page.tsx`)

Large 2877-line page with 8 tabs (`sentinel/page.tsx:541-548`):

| Tab | Label |
|---|---|
| general | General |
| profiles | Profiles |
| memguard | MemGuard |
| prompts | Analysis Prompts |
| llm | LLM Configuration |
| stats | Statistics |
| exceptions | Exceptions |
| hierarchy | Hierarchy |

**Enforcement Modes** (`sentinel/page.tsx:787-790`):

| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| `block` | Analyze and block detected threats (recommended) |
| `warn_only` | Analyze and flag threats without blocking |
| `detect_only` | Analyze and log threats silently (audit mode) |
| `off` | Disable Sentinel analysis entirely |

**Analysis Toggles** (`sentinel/page.tsx:696-699`):

| Key | Label |
|---|---|
| `enable_prompt_analysis` | Prompt Analysis — analyze user messages for injection attempts |
| `enable_tool_analysis` | Tool Analysis — analyze tool arguments |
| `enable_shell_analysis` | Shell Analysis — analyze shell commands |
| `enable_slash_command_analysis` | Slash Command Analysis — analyze `/invoke`, `/shell` (disable to bypass) |

**Detection Toggles** (`sentinel/page.tsx:841-846`):

| Key | Label | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| `detect_prompt_injection` | Prompt Injection | high |
| `detect_agent_takeover` | Agent Takeover | high |
| `detect_poisoning` | Poisoning Attacks | medium |
| `detect_shell_malicious_intent` | Shell Malicious Intent | critical |
| `detect_browser_ssrf` | Browser SSRF | critical |
| `detect_vector_store_poisoning` | Vector Store Poisoning | high |

Aggressiveness slider: multi-level labels (`:885-894`) — specific labels not enumerated here.

### 21.13 API Clients (`frontend/app/settings/api-clients/page.tsx`)

Create / list / rotate / revoke API clients for the Public API v1.

**Create form** (`api-clients/page.tsx:365-405`):

| Field | Type | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Name * | Input (`placeholder="e.g., CRM Integration"`) | `:365-371` |
| Description | Textarea (`placeholder="What will this client be used for?"`) | `:376-382` |
| Role | Select (5 role options, below) | `:387-395` |
| Rate Limit (requests/minute) | Numeric input | `:400` |

**API Roles** (`api-clients/page.tsx:14-19`):

| Value | Label | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `api_agent_only` | Agent Only | Can list agents and chat (read + execute) |
| `api_readonly` | Read Only | Can view agents, contacts, memory, analytics |
| `api_member` | Member | Can create/update agents, contacts, flows, knowledge |
| `api_admin` | Admin | Full API access except billing and team |
| `api_owner` | Owner | Full API access including org settings and audit |

On creation the UI reveals **Client ID** (`:450`) and **Client Secret** (`:469`) once — the secret must be copied before navigating away.

### 21.14 Message Filtering (`frontend/app/settings/filtering/page.tsx`)

**Purpose:** Global filters for WhatsApp/Telegram message intake (mirrors per-instance filters described in §15.1).

| Field | Type | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Group name (allowlist) | Input (`placeholder="Enter group name (exact match)"`) | `filtering/page.tsx:220` |
| Phone number (DM allowlist) | Input (`placeholder="Enter phone number (e.g., +5500000000001)"`) | `filtering/page.tsx:275` |
| Keyword filter | Input (`placeholder="Enter keyword"`) | `filtering/page.tsx:330` |
| DM Auto Mode | Labelled toggle (`dmAutoMode`) | `filtering/page.tsx:387` |

These values persist into `Config.group_filters` / `Config.number_filters` (JSON arrays) on the tenant config row.

---

## 22. System Admin (Global Admin Only)

All global admin pages are under `frontend/app/system/` and are only accessible to users with the `is_global_admin` flag set on the `User` model.

### 22.1 Tenant Management (`frontend/app/system/tenants/`)

- `tenants/page.tsx` — list all tenants (create, activate, suspend).
- `tenants/[id]/` — per-tenant detail subroute (not enumerated in this pass).

Backing service: `backend/services/audit_service.py` (global admin actions logged as `tenant.create`, `tenant.suspend`, etc. — see §23).

### 22.2 User Management (`frontend/app/system/users/page.tsx`)

Global user directory — list all users across tenants, toggle `is_global_admin`, reset credentials, suspend accounts.

### 22.3 Platform Integrations (`frontend/app/system/integrations/page.tsx`)

Platform-level third-party credentials (keys that apply globally, not per-tenant). This is the global counterpart to §21.4.

### 22.4 Plans / Subscription Tiers (`frontend/app/system/plans/page.tsx`)

Define plan tiers (Free, Pro, Enterprise, etc.) with quotas and feature toggles. Each tenant's current plan is visible on the Organization page (§21.1).

### 22.5 Remote Access (Cloudflare Tunnel) — v0.6.0

**Primary sources:**
- `backend/services/cloudflare_tunnel_service.py` — subprocess lifecycle, supervisor, metrics probe
- `backend/services/remote_access_config_service.py` — DB CRUD + optimistic concurrency + audit
- `backend/api/routes_remote_access.py` — REST surface under `/api/admin/remote-access/*`
- `backend/auth_routes.py::_enforce_remote_access_gate` — per-tenant login gate
- `frontend/app/system/remote-access/page.tsx` — Global Admin UI

Remote Access exposes the whole Tsushin instance through a single Cloudflare Tunnel so users can log in from outside the internal network. The feature is **off by default** at both the system level (`RemoteAccessConfig.enabled=false`) and the per-tenant level (`Tenant.remote_access_enabled=false`). There are two layers of control:

1. **System tunnel** (managed by the Global Admin in `/system/remote-access`): configures and runs the `cloudflared` subprocess inside the backend container.
2. **Per-tenant entitlement** (managed by the Global Admin per tenant): gates which tenants' users can actually log in via the public URL. Users from tenants without the entitlement get an HTTP 403 with the error code `REMOTE_ACCESS_TENANT_DISABLED` and the message "Remote access is not enabled for this tenant. Contact your administrator." The attempt is written to the tenant audit log as `auth.remote_access.denied` (severity=warning).

#### 22.5.1 Architecture

                                 └────────────────────────────┘
```

Key properties:
- `cloudflared` runs as a supervised Python subprocess inside `tsushin-backend` (not a separate compose sidecar). A supervisor task restarts it up to 3 times with 5s/15s/30s backoff before giving up and marking `status=error`.
- Readiness is confirmed by polling `cloudflared`'s Prometheus metrics endpoint for a `cloudflared_tunnel_ha_connections > 0` line — named mode no longer relies on a race-condition-prone sleep.
- Cloudflare terminates TLS at the edge. The tunnel forwards plain HTTP to the local Caddy proxy on port 80, which then routes `/api/*` and `/ws/*` to the backend and everything else to the frontend. This is why `install.py` generates a `:80` site block in every SSL mode; without it, tunnel requests would bypass Caddy's `/api` routing and the frontend's API calls would 502.
- The tunnel token is encrypted at rest with a dedicated Fernet key (`config.remote_access_encryption_key`), which itself is wrapped with `TSN_MASTER_KEY` (SEC-006 envelope pattern). The plaintext token is never logged, never returned in any API response, and only surfaced as the boolean `tunnel_token_configured` in the GET config endpoint.
- Optimistic concurrency on config writes: the PUT endpoint takes an `expected_updated_at` and returns HTTP 409 if the stored `updated_at` has moved since the admin last read it.

#### 22.5.2 Tunnel modes

| Mode | When to use | URL | Persistence | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Quick** | Dev, demos, smoke tests | Random `https://<words>.trycloudflare.com` | Ephemeral (new URL per start) | None — any visitor can reach it |
| **Named** | Production / enterprise | Custom FQDN (e.g. `https://tsushin.acme.com`) | Stable; bound to a Cloudflare Tunnel in your Zero Trust account | Tunnel token pinned to your Cloudflare account; add Zero Trust Access policies if you want additional auth on top of Tsushin's own login |

In both modes, Tsushin's own RBAC + per-tenant entitlement still apply.

#### 22.5.3 Setting up a Named Tunnel (production)

One-time Cloudflare setup (only needed for Named mode):

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard → **Zero Trust** → **Networks** → **Connectors** (previously "Tunnels").
2. **Create a tunnel** → choose **Cloudflared** → name it (e.g. `tsushin`). Cloudflare generates a connector token — copy it; you'll need it in a moment.
3. Go to **Published application routes** → **Add a published application route**:
   - **Subdomain + Domain**: pick the hostname you want (e.g. `tsushin` + `acme.com` → `tsushin.acme.com`). Cloudflare will auto-create the DNS record for you.
   - **Path**: leave empty.
   - **Service type**: HTTP.
   - **Service URL**: `tsushin-proxy:80` (the Caddy reverse proxy inside your Docker network). **Do not** use `frontend:3030` — that would bypass Caddy and break `/api` routing.
   - Tsushin now defaults saved tunnel targets to the stack proxy service and rejects starts when that proxy/Caddy layer is unreachable, rather than booting a broken public route.

Tsushin setup:

1. Log in as a Global Admin and navigate to **System Administration** → **Remote Access** (`/system/remote-access`).
2. In the **Tunnel Configuration** card:
   - Check **Feature enabled globally**.
   - Select **Named** mode.
   - Paste the **Tunnel hostname** (e.g. `tsushin.acme.com`).
   - Paste the **Tunnel token** from Cloudflare (write-only — placeholder turns to `●●●●●● (configured)` after save).
   - Optionally toggle **Auto-start on boot (with supervisor)** so the tunnel survives backend restarts.
   - Click **Save configuration**.
3. Scroll to the **Google OAuth callback URIs** card. **Before** starting the tunnel, copy both URIs and add them to your Google Cloud Console OAuth 2.0 client (**APIs & Services → Credentials → your OAuth client → Authorized redirect URIs**):
   - `https://<hostname>/api/auth/google/callback` (SSO login)
   - `https://<hostname>/api/hub/google/oauth/callback` (Hub Gmail/Calendar integrations)
   - Skipping this step will break Google SSO for users arriving via the public URL.
4. In the **Tunnel Status** card, select **Named** in the mode dropdown and click **Start**. Within 10–15 seconds the badge will turn green (`Running`) and the public URL field will show your hostname.
5. Open `https://<hostname>` in a browser — you should see the Tsushin login page.

#### 22.5.4 Enabling remote access for a specific tenant

Even after the tunnel is running, no tenant can actually log in through the public URL until the Global Admin enables their `remote_access_enabled` flag. Two ways to do it:

**Option A — from `/system/remote-access` (fastest for bulk toggles):**
1. Scroll to the **Per-tenant entitlement** card at the bottom.
2. Find the tenant in the table and click the toggle in the **Remote Access** column. The toggle is optimistic (instant visual feedback with rollback on error).
3. The "Last changed" column updates with the admin's email. Both the global audit log and the tenant-scoped audit log record the change (`remote_access.tenant.enabled` or `remote_access.tenant.disabled`).

**Option B — from the tenant detail page:**
1. Navigate to **System Administration** → **Tenant Management** → click into the specific tenant.
2. Scroll to the **Remote Access** card and flip the toggle.
3. Same audit trail as Option A.

**What happens behind the scenes:**
- A user from an enabled tenant logs in at `https://<hostname>/auth/login` → normal login flow, normal JWT, normal dashboard.
- A user from a disabled tenant sees a banner on the login page: "Remote access is not enabled for this tenant. Contact your administrator." → 403 response, no JWT issued, `auth.remote_access.denied` written to their tenant audit log.
- Global admins (`user.tenant_id IS NULL`) always pass the gate — they can always reach the system via the public URL.
- **Internal network access is unaffected.** The gate only fires when the request's `Host` / `X-Forwarded-Host` header matches the configured `tunnel_hostname`. Requests coming in via `https://localhost` or direct to `tsushin-backend:8081` skip the gate entirely.

#### 22.5.5 Quick Tunnel (dev / demo)

For quick spot-checks you can skip the named-tunnel setup entirely:

1. `/system/remote-access` → **Tunnel Status** → mode dropdown = **Quick** → **Start**.
2. Within 30 seconds the public URL field shows a random `https://<words>.trycloudflare.com` URL.
3. Share that URL with the demo audience; it stays alive until you click **Stop** or restart the backend.
4. Per-tenant entitlement still applies.

Quick tunnels are intentionally unauthenticated at the Cloudflare layer — anyone with the URL can reach Tsushin's login page. The per-tenant gate + Tsushin login + (optionally) Google SSO are the only things protecting it. **Never use quick mode for production traffic.**

#### 22.5.6 Status, lifecycle, and troubleshooting

The Status card polls `GET /api/admin/remote-access/status` every 5 seconds while the tab is visible (it pauses when you switch away, per the `document.visibilityState` API). State values:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `stopped` | Subprocess is not running. Default state after boot if autostart is off. |
| `starting` | Subprocess is launching; readiness probe hasn't confirmed yet. |
| `running` | Subprocess is up and connected to the Cloudflare edge (≥1 HA connection). |
| `stopping` | Graceful stop in progress (SIGTERM → 10s → SIGKILL → 5s ladder). |
| `crashed` | Subprocess exited unexpectedly; supervisor may be about to restart. |
| `error` | Supervisor gave up after 3 restart attempts — manual intervention required. |
| `unavailable` | `cloudflared` binary not found in the backend container (should never happen with the shipped Dockerfile). |

Common errors surfaced in `last_error`:
- **"Named tunnel failed readiness probe (no HA connections in 15s)"** — the tunnel token is wrong, the hostname isn't bound to any route, or outbound QUIC/HTTPS is blocked by your firewall. Double-check the token and the Cloudflare Dashboard route.
- **"Quick tunnel timed out waiting for URL"** — cloudflared couldn't reach the `trycloudflare.com` edge. Network / egress issue.
- **"Supervisor gave up after 3 restart attempts"** — cloudflared keeps crashing. Check `docker logs tsushin-backend | grep cloudflared` for the underlying error; typical causes: invalid token, revoked route, stale DNS record.

#### 22.5.7 Public vs gated endpoint policy

Remote Access exposes the same Tsushin app over a public hostname, so the safe posture is "public only when the route is intentionally bootstrap-, docs-, or webhook-related; everything else is gated." After the v0.6.0 hardening follow-up, the expected anonymous/public surface is:

- `GET /api/health` and `GET /api/readiness`
- Auth/bootstrap flows such as `GET /api/auth/setup-status`, `POST /api/auth/setup-wizard`, login, Google callback exchange, and explicit password-reset flows
- `GET /api/plans/` (public plan catalog)
- Inbound webhook receivers that do not use session auth and instead enforce their own signature/secret validation, such as `POST /api/webhooks/{id}/inbound`
- Static metadata/docs endpoints such as `/api/v1/openapi.json` and `/api/v1/docs`
- `GET /api/provider-instances/predefined-models`
- `POST /api/provider-instances/discover-models-raw` only before first-run provisioning (`needs_setup=true`)

The routes specifically tightened for public Remote Access are now gated as follows:

- `POST /api/provider-instances/discover-models-raw`: requires `org.settings.write` after the first user exists
- `GET /api/skills/available`: requires `agents.read`
- `GET /api/shell/beacon/version`: requires a valid active `ShellIntegration` API key in `X-API-Key`
- `GET /api/shell/beacon/download`: requires either `X-API-Key` for an active `ShellIntegration` or a valid signed-in session with `shell.read`
- `GET /api/ollama/health`: requires an authenticated session

One accepted exception remains: Playground audio/image asset URLs (`/api/playground/audio/{uuid}` and `/api/playground/images/{uuid}`) are capability URLs. They intentionally stay unauthenticated because browsers cannot attach bearer/session headers to `<audio>` and `<img>` fetches in the same way, and the UUID itself is treated as the unguessable bearer capability. The hardening pass did not change that behavior.

#### 22.5.8 Security considerations

- **Token at rest:** Fernet (AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256) with a per-feature key that's envelope-wrapped by `TSN_MASTER_KEY`. Rotating `TSN_MASTER_KEY` without re-encrypting the token will cause `_load_config` to throw and the tunnel will refuse to start — document the rotation procedure in your runbook.
- **Token in transit:** never logged, never returned in any API response, never surfaced to the frontend beyond a boolean `tunnel_token_configured` flag.
- **Login gate:** enforced on both the password login path and the Google SSO exchange path. Host header spoofing from inside your LAN is possible but accepted — the gate is permissive (allows local access) by design, and your internal network is assumed to be trusted. External attackers can only reach the backend via the tunnel, which enforces the hostname upstream.
- **Global admin bypass:** intentional — the platform operator always needs a way in, even if every tenant is disabled.
- **Audit:** every config change fires `remote_access.config.updated` on `GlobalAdminAuditLog`. Tenant entitlement changes fire on BOTH the global stream and the tenant-scoped stream. Denied logins fire `auth.remote_access.denied` on the tenant-scoped stream with `severity=warning`.
- **Rotating the tunnel token:** paste a new token in the Config card and click Save. If the tunnel is currently running, the backend performs a stop→start cycle automatically (`reload_config()`).

#### 22.5.9 Disabling the feature

To fully disable remote access for every tenant without tearing the config down:

1. `/system/remote-access` → **Tunnel Status** → **Stop**.
2. (Optional) In **Tunnel Configuration**, uncheck **Feature enabled globally** → Save.

To restore it later, just click Start — the encrypted token and hostname are preserved.

## 23. Audit Logging & Compliance

**Primary sources:**
- `backend/services/audit_service.py` (563 lines) — `AuditService` class
- `backend/services/audit_retention_worker.py` — retention enforcement
- `backend/services/syslog_service.py` (335 lines) — RFC 5424 formatter + sender
- `backend/services/syslog_forwarder.py` (297 lines) — async queue + worker
- `models_rbac.py` — `GlobalAdminAuditLog`, `AuditEvent`

### 23.1 Event Types & Severity

`AuditService` exposes two logging entry points:

- **`log_action()`** (`audit_service.py:28-79`) — for global admin actions. Writes `GlobalAdminAuditLog` rows with fields: `global_admin_id`, `action` (e.g., `tenant.create`, `user.suspend`), `target_tenant_id`, `resource_type`, `resource_id`, `details_json`, `ip_address`, `user_agent`.
- **`log_event()` / `log_tenant_event()`** (`audit_service.py:302-326`, `:497-554`) — for tenant-scoped audit events written to `AuditEvent`. Default severity is `"info"`.

**Severity levels** (used in queries and filters, `audit_service.py:354-407`):

| Severity |
|---|
| `info` |
| `warning` |
| `critical` |

The audit-logs UI exposes the same three (plus "All Severities") — see §21.7.

**Action categories** (from the UI filter catalog, `audit-logs/page.tsx:40-66`): auth, agent, flow, contact, settings, security, api_client, skill, mcp, team.

**Channels**: web, api, whatsapp, telegram, system.

### 23.2 Filtering, CSV Export, Retention

- Query API supports filtering by severity, action, channel, date range (`audit_service.py:338-407`).
- CSV export is implemented via Python `csv` + `io` (`audit_service.py:12-13`, `:476`) streaming rows to the client.
- Retention is enforced by `backend/services/audit_retention_worker.py` — a background worker that purges events older than the configured retention window.

### 23.3 Syslog Forwarding

Source files: `backend/services/syslog_service.py`, `backend/services/syslog_forwarder.py`.

- **Format:** RFC 5424 via `RFC5424Formatter` (`syslog_service.py:25`).
- **Transports:** UDP, TCP, TLS (Protocol selector in the UI — §21.7).
- **Facility:** Configurable per-tenant. Supported values exposed in UI: `1` User-level, `4` Auth, `10` Auth-priv, `13` Audit, `16-23` Local0–Local7 (`audit-logs/page.tsx:264-275`). Default facility when unset is `1` (`syslog_forwarder.py:75`).
- **TLS:** Encrypted CA cert, client cert, and client key stored on the tenant config, decrypted at forward time with namespaces `syslog_ca_cert_{tenant_id}`, `syslog_client_cert_{tenant_id}`, `syslog_client_key_{tenant_id}` (`syslog_forwarder.py:117-134`).
- **Delivery:** Non-blocking queue enqueue (`syslog_forwarder.py:31`) consumed by a background worker — `start_syslog_forwarder(engine, queue_size=10000, batch_size=50, poll_interval_ms=200)` (`syslog_forwarder.py:268-285`). Stopped via `stop_syslog_forwarder()` (`:291`).

## 24. Observability

### 24.1 Watcher dashboard tabs

Watcher is the frontend observability surface. Tabs per `README.md:178-188`:

| Tab | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Dashboard** | KPIs, activity timeline, system performance, distribution charts. |
| **Conversations** | Live conversation feed with filtering. |
| **Flows** | Flow execution tracking & status. |
| **Billing** | Token usage and cost analytics per agent/model. |
| **Security** | Sentinel threat events with severity filtering. |
| **Graph View** | Interactive system topology (agents, users, projects) with Dagre auto-layout, node expand/collapse, fullscreen mode. |

Access requires the `watcher.read` permission (`backend/migrations/add_rbac_tables.py:387-388`).

### 24.2 Prometheus metrics (`/metrics`)

The `/metrics` endpoint is registered in `backend/app.py:1314`:

```python
app.add_api_route("/metrics", metrics_endpoint, methods=["GET"], include_in_schema=False)
```

* Enabled by default; disable with `TSN_METRICS_ENABLED=false` (`backend/settings.py:139`).
* Optional bearer token for scraping: `TSN_METRICS_SCRAPE_TOKEN` (`backend/services/metrics_service.py:109`). When set, scrapers must present `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
* Implemented by `backend/services/metrics_service.py`.

### 24.3 Health & readiness probes

| Endpoint | Purpose | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/health` | Lightweight liveness probe — returns `{"status":"healthy"}` without external dependency checks. | `backend/api/routes.py:70` |
| `GET /api/readiness` | Readiness probe — checks PostgreSQL engine + connectivity. Returns **200** when all components healthy, **503** when any is degraded. Response body: `{"status":"ready"/"degraded", "postgresql":{...}}`. | `backend/api/routes.py:84-138` |

In Kubernetes, wire these to `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe` respectively.

### 24.4 Token usage & cost tracking

* Watcher's **Billing** tab surfaces token usage and estimated cost per agent + per model.
* Cost estimation is driven by the **Model Pricing** settings (`backend/api/routes_model_pricing.py`, paths `/api/settings/model-pricing`, `/api/settings/model-pricing/{model_provider}/{model_name}`).
* Token counts are recorded as `AuditEvent` rows (`models_rbac.py:233-253`) and aggregated in the Analytics service (`backend/api/routes_analytics.py`).

## 25. Public API v1

All Public API v1 endpoints are mounted under `/api/v1/` via the aggregator router at `backend/api/v1/router.py`. OpenAPI/Swagger UI is available at `/docs`. Source: `backend/api/v1/router.py:1-23`, `README.md:228-236`.

If you generate an external client/SDK, fetch `http://<host>:8081/openapi.json` to a local file first and generate from that file. During the 2026-04-07 Ubuntu VM audit, file-based generation was more reliable than pointing code generators directly at the live URL.

### 25.1 Authentication

Two equivalent modes — choose whichever fits your client:

**Mode 1 — OAuth2 Client Credentials** (`backend/api/v1/routes_oauth.py:23`):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/oauth/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=$CLIENT_ID&client_secret=$CLIENT_SECRET"
# → { "access_token": "<jwt>", "token_type": "bearer", "expires_in": 3600 }
# NOTE (BUG-535): The Content-Type header is required. Omitting it causes FastAPI to return
# 422 "Field required: grant_type" even though the field is present in the body.

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt>" http://localhost:8081/api/v1/agents
```

**Mode 2 — Direct API Key** (use the secret from `/api/clients` directly):

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: $TSN_API_CLIENT_SECRET" http://localhost:8081/api/v1/agents
```

The unified auth dependency (`backend/api/api_auth.py:46-80`) resolves both modes into an `ApiCaller` with `tenant_id`, `permissions`, and `rate_limit_rpm`.

### 25.2 Rate limiting

Every API-v1 response carries standard rate-limit headers (`backend/middleware/rate_limiter.py:192-215`):

| Header | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum requests per minute for this caller. |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Remaining quota in the current window. |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | UNIX timestamp (seconds) when the window resets. |

On **429 Too Many Requests** (`backend/api/v1/schemas.py:174`) the same three headers are set; clients should back off until `X-RateLimit-Reset`.

Per-client `rate_limit_rpm` is stored on the `ApiClient` record (default 60 RPM; seeded regression clients may be provisioned at a higher limit, e.g. 120 RPM).

| POST | `/api/webhooks/{webhook_id}/inbound` | `routes_webhook_inbound.py` |
| GET | `/api/settings/model-pricing` | `routes_model_pricing.py` |

### 25.5 Admin API reference

**Tenants** (`backend/api/routes_tenants.py`, prefix `/api/tenants`, global-admin only):

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/tenants` | List tenants (paginated). |
| POST | `/api/tenants` | Create tenant. |
| GET | `/api/tenants/current` | Current caller's tenant. |
| GET | `/api/tenants/{tenant_id}` | Tenant detail. |
| PUT | `/api/tenants/{tenant_id}` | Update tenant. |
| DELETE | `/api/tenants/{tenant_id}` | Soft-delete tenant. |
| GET | `/api/tenants/{tenant_id}/stats` | Tenant usage statistics. |

**System configuration** (routers mounted in `backend/app.py`):

* `plans_router` → `/api/plans*` — Subscription plan management.
* `sso_config_router` → `/api/sso-config*` — Per-tenant Google SSO config (`tenant_sso_config` table).
* `global_users_router` → `/api/global/users*` — Cross-tenant user administration.
* `system_ai_router` → `/api/system/ai*` — System-wide AI provider config.
* `syslog_config_router` → `/api/tenants/*/syslog*` — Per-tenant syslog forwarding (`tenant_syslog_config` table, `models_rbac.py:309-344`).

Source: `backend/app.py:1270-1309`.

### 25.6 Webhooks (bidirectional, HMAC-signed)

The webhook channel (`backend/channels/webhook/adapter.py`) is bidirectional:

**Inbound** — external systems POST signed events to `POST /api/webhooks/{webhook_id}/inbound` (`backend/api/routes_webhook_inbound.py`). Events are enqueued into `MessageQueue`; `QueueWorker._handle_webhook` routes them to the target agent.

**Outbound** — agent responses are HMAC-signed and POSTed to the webhook's `callback_url`. Signing uses `hmac.new(secret, signed_input, sha256)` (`channels/webhook/adapter.py:148`). Outbound requests carry custom headers:

* `X-Tsushin-Webhook-Id: <int>`
* `X-Tsushin-Signature: <hex sha256 HMAC>`
* (plus timestamp fields — see `channels/webhook/adapter.py:131-155`)

Callback URLs are subject to SSRF policy enforcement (`channels/webhook/adapter.py:125`). The `api_secret_encrypted` column on `WebhookIntegration` is Fernet-encrypted using a per-tenant-derived webhook key (`get_webhook_encryption_key`, `channels/webhook/adapter.py:72-85`). Webhooks can be configured as inbound-only (outbound disabled) by leaving `callback_url` empty.

## 26. Slash Commands (System-Wide Catalog)

**Registry source:** `backend/models.py:1197` (`SlashCommand` model) + seeded rows in `backend/db.py` (the `_system` tenant holds all built-in commands).
**Handler source:** `backend/services/slash_command_service.py`.

Seed entries (`backend/db.py:830-1259`, all `tenant_id="_system"`, `handler_type="built-in"`):

| thread | `thread list` | `^/thread\s+list$` | List active conversation threads for this sender |
| thread | `thread status` | `^/thread\s+status$` | Show current thread details (objective, progress, time) |

**Total: 37 built-in commands** (26 seeded in `db.py` + 11 added via migrations).

**Tenant customization:** `SlashCommand.tenant_id` supports per-tenant overrides; the service query unions the tenant and `_system` rows (`slash_command_service.py:58-73`). Tenant custom commands are managed under **Settings → Prompts & Patterns → Slash Commands** (§21.11).

**Handler dispatch:** `SlashCommandService` (`slash_command_service.py:20`) matches the incoming text against each command's regex `pattern`, filters by `language_code`, and routes to the matching built-in handler. If a command resolves to a sandboxed tool name, execution is delegated through `_parse_tool_arguments` → `ToolDiscoveryService`. Flag-style args (`--target`) are rejected for sandboxed tools (`:1668`) — use `param=value` syntax instead.

**`/help` behavior** (`slash_command_service.py:1017-1086`): `/help` lists all commands grouped by category; `/help <command>` shows syntax + examples for one command; `/help all` renders every command's first-line usage.

/tool dig lookup domain=google.com record_type=MX
/tool nuclei start_scan url=http://testphp.vulnweb.com

/inject list                     — List buffered tool executions
/inject clear                    — Clear inject buffer
```

**Shell → `/inject` integration (BUG-510, 2026-04-10):** `/shell` executions are now visible to `/inject`. Fire-and-forget `/shell` writes a **pending stub** tagged `source='shell_command'` with the beacon command id stored in metadata; `wait_for_result=True` calls buffer the final stdout/stderr immediately. On every `/inject list` or `/inject <id>` call, `SlashCommandService._resolve_pending_shell_executions` pulls updated results via `ShellCommandService.get_command_result` for any pending shell entries (capped at 10 per call) and rewrites their buffered output once the beacon marks the command `completed`/`failed`/`timeout`. Pending entries render with a `[pending]` suffix in `to_reference_string()`.

#### Flow commands
```
/flows list                      — List all workflows
/flows run "Daily Report"        — Execute a workflow by name
/flows run 42                    — Execute a workflow by ID
```

## 27. CLI & Tester MCP

**Source:** `backend/tester-mcp/README.md`, `backend/tester-mcp/main.go`

The Tester MCP is a containerized Go WhatsApp bridge dedicated to QA. It is configured with its own phone number and runs alongside production MCP containers on `tsushin-network`.

> **Fresh-install note (BUG-537):** The tester MCP container is **not bundled** in the default compose stack (`docker-compose.yml`). On a fresh install, `GET /api/mcp/instances/tester/status` returns `container_state: "not_found"` and Hub → Communication → WhatsApp is empty. To provision a tester instance manually:
> 1. Navigate to **Hub → Communication → WhatsApp**.
> 2. Click **+ New Instance** and create a new runtime WhatsApp instance.
> 3. Assign it a dedicated QA phone number (must differ from all tenant agent numbers).
> 4. Scan the QR code to authenticate.
> 5. The backend will automatically recognise the active tester instance for `/api/mcp/instances/tester/*` controls.
> 6. Use `POST http://localhost:8088/api/send` (if the legacy compose tester is present) or call the runtime instance API for round-trip test sends.

**Default port:** `8088` (host) → `8080` (container).

**Env vars:**

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `PHONE_NUMBER` | Tester's WhatsApp phone number | — |
| `PORT` | Container-internal port | 8080 |

**HTTP endpoints** (`tester-mcp/README.md:48-53`):

| Method + Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/health` | Health check |
| `POST /api/send` | Send a WhatsApp message |
| `POST /api/download` | Download media |
| `GET /api/qr-code` | Get QR code for initial auth |

**Authentication:** Bearer token on `Authorization: Bearer <api_secret>` (per project conventions; exact secret provisioning is container-specific — see the tester container's env).

**Hub visibility:** Hub now shows runtime tester instances in the main WhatsApp list, while the dedicated **QA Tester** controls backed by `/api/mcp/instances/tester/*` resolve the current tester target for QR/auth/restart actions. Those controls prefer a legacy/compose tester container when present and otherwise target the tenant's active runtime tester instance.

**Stdio launcher baseline:** The tenant toolbox base image ships `uvx`, and the Hub stdio/MCP launcher guidance is aligned to that shipped runtime. Use approved launchers such as `uvx` rather than assuming host-local package managers inside the backend container.

**Tester vs. tenant agent separation:** the tester is a dedicated QA bridge, not a tenant-managed production instance. For meaningful end-to-end validation, the tester and the tenant agent must authenticate with different WhatsApp accounts/phone numbers. If the same phone number is reused, `/api/mcp/instances/tester/status` and `/api/mcp/instances/{id}/health` now surface warning strings, and tenant-agent creation is rejected when the requested number is already in use by an authenticated tester or another WhatsApp MCP instance.

**Send-message example:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/api/send \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_secret>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"recipient": "<msisdn_without_plus>", "message": "<test_command>"}'
```

**Sandboxed tool command format** (supported over this channel — see §26):
- Format: `/tool <tool_name> <command_name> param=value`
- Example: `/tool nmap quick_scan target=scanme.nmap.org`
- Example: `/tool dig lookup domain=google.com`
- Note: command-line flags like `--target` are **not** supported by the sandboxed-tool parser; use `param=value`.

**Round-trip verification pattern** (used by regression tests):
1. Tester sends via `POST /api/send` → verify tester logs show `Message sent true`.
2. Agent MCP container logs show `STORAGE SUCCESS`.
3. Wait ~30-60 s for LLM processing + conversation delay.
4. Tester logs show an inbound arrow from the bot's LID number.
5. If silent, inspect backend logs for `generate|gemini|send` lines.

**Validation prerequisite:** do not scan the tester QR and the tenant agent QR with the same WhatsApp account. That topology can look healthy in status checks while making tester-to-agent round-trip validation impossible.

## 28. Troubleshooting

### 28.1 Container won't start

```bash
docker compose logs backend                 # Read the stack trace
docker inspect tsushin-backend --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}'
lsof -i :8081                               # Port collision?
curl http://localhost:8081/api/health       # Liveness
curl http://localhost:8081/api/readiness    # DB connectivity
```

Source: `docs/docker.md:260-272`.

### 28.2 WhatsApp session dropped / QR re-auth loop

Symptoms: the MCP container for a WhatsApp number keeps regenerating QR codes in `docker logs mcp-agent-tenant_<id>`.

Cause: The `tsushin-network` bridge was torn down (historically via `docker compose down`), severing the WebSocket to `whatsmeow`.

Fix:

```bash
docker restart mcp-agent-tenant_<id>    # Restart container
# Then re-scan QR on the linked phone.
```

Prevention: never `docker compose down` for routine rebuilds — use `docker compose build --no-cache <service>` followed by `docker compose up -d <service>` instead. The compose file declares `tsushin-network` as `external: true`, so the network survives, but the compose services still restart if you tear them down.

### 28.3 Database issues

```bash
docker exec -it tsushin-postgres psql -U tsushin -d tsushin -c "\dt"     # List tables
docker exec -it tsushin-postgres psql -U tsushin -d tsushin              # Interactive shell
```

Source: `docs/docker.md:275-282`.

**Playground search note:** Postgres deployments do not use SQLite FTS5. Tsushin now falls back cleanly to LIKE-based conversation search on Postgres and rolls back failed search probes before continuing, so a failed search should not poison the rest of the request transaction.

### 28.4 Memory / slow model loading

The backend lazy-loads `sentence-transformers` models; first boot can be slow. Pre-warm:

```bash
docker exec tsushin-backend python -c \
  "from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer; SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')"
```

Or raise Docker Desktop memory limit to ≥ 6 GB. Source: `docs/docker.md:286-294`.

### 28.5 Permission issues on bind mounts (Linux)

```bash
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 backend/data/
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 logs/
```

Source: `docs/docker.md:298-301`.

### 28.6 Disk space

Builds accumulate layers and BuildKit cache. Prune periodically:

```bash
docker system df                        # Report
docker system prune -af --volumes=false # KEEPS named volumes (Postgres)
docker builder prune -af                # Clear BuildKit cache
```

Never use `--volumes` in prune — that destroys `tsushin-postgres-data`.

### 28.7 Worktree Docker data mismatch

If you start Docker from a git worktree (e.g. `~/.claude-worktrees/...`), the empty `backend/data/` inside the worktree will be bind-mounted, making all tenant data appear missing. The fix: **always** run `docker compose` from the main repository clone. If you did start from a worktree, `docker stop tsushin-backend tsushin-frontend && docker rm tsushin-backend tsushin-frontend` and restart from the canonical path.

Note: Postgres data lives in the `tsushin-postgres-data` named volume and is NOT affected by working directory. Only ChromaDB vectors and per-MCP-instance data in `backend/data/` are at risk.
