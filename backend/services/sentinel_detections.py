Sentinel Detection Type Registry - Phase 20

Defines available detection types and their metadata.
Designed for extensibility - new detection types can be added here.

This module provides:
1. DETECTION_REGISTRY - All available detection types with metadata
2. DEFAULT_PROMPTS - Analysis prompts per detection type and aggressiveness level
3. Helper functions for working with detection types
