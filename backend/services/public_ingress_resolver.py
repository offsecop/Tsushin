"""Public ingress resolver — single source of truth for "what public HTTPS URL
reaches this backend on behalf of this tenant".

Before v0.6.1 three features each answered this question differently:

  1. `tenant.public_base_url` — free-text HTTPS string a tenant admin pasted,
     consumed directly by SlackSetupWizard / DiscordSetupWizard.
  2. Global Remote Access tunnel (`CloudflareTunnelService.public_url`) —
     live tunnel URL only visible to global admins on /system/remote-access.
  3. WebhookSetupModal — used `window.location.origin` client-side, which
     silently broke when an admin browsed via LAN IP.

This resolver returns an authoritative `IngressResult` with a `source` field
so every consumer (Slack/Discord wizards, Webhook modal, PublicBaseUrlCard)
renders the same URL, with a clear provenance badge.

Precedence (highest to lowest):
  1. override — tenant.public_base_url, if set and format-valid
  2. tunnel  — platform Cloudflare tunnel, if state == "running" and it has
               a public_url (ingress does NOT require the login-only
               `remote_access_enabled` flag — those concerns are decoupled)
  3. dev     — TSUSHIN_DEV_PUBLIC_BASE_URL env, if set
  4. none    — no ingress configured

Design notes:
  - The resolver is pure-sync and performs no network I/O. Format validation
    is cheap; DNS resolution is the caller's responsibility (done at write
    time in routes_tenant_settings._dns_check).
  - Reading `_state.public_url` on the tunnel singleton without the asyncio
    lock is safe *only* under the service's --workers 1 deployment (see
    cloudflare_tunnel_service.py:25-27). CPython's GIL makes the pointer
    read atomic and `_state` is rebound as a whole snapshot under the lock,
    so a reader sees either the previous or the new complete snapshot — no
    torn fields. Under --workers N each worker has its own singleton with
    an independent state; the resolver in a non-owner worker would read
    whatever that worker's last cached snapshot was, which is a separate
    (pre-existing) correctness problem the feature inherits but does not
    cause.
  - If the override URL fails format validation, we keep source="override"
    and emit a `warning` rather than silently falling through — see
    reviewer feedback (silent demotion hides misconfiguration).
