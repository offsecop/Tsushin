## [Unreleased] - develop

### Added

#### MongoDB Local Mode for Vector Stores
- **Local cosine similarity fallback**: MongoDB adapter now supports self-hosted MongoDB 7.0+ without Atlas Vector Search. Toggle "Local Mode" in the UI to use Python-side cosine similarity instead of Atlas `$vectorSearch` aggregation.
- **Registry integration**: `use_native_search` config option passed from `extra_config` through the provider registry.
- **UI toggle**: MongoAtlasConfigForm has a "Local Mode" toggle that sets `use_native_search: false`.

#### A2A Communication Memory Enrichment
- **Cross-agent memory retrieval**: When Agent A asks Agent B via A2A communication, Agent B's vector store is now searched for relevant memories and injected into the A2A prompt context. This enables agents to recall facts from their external vector stores (Qdrant, MongoDB) during inter-agent conversations.
- **disable_skills flag**: Target agents in A2A calls no longer have access to skills/tools, preventing recursive tool invocations. Pure LLM-only responses using memory context.

#### Dynamic Vector Store Vendor Labels
- **MongoDB vs Atlas badges**: Vector Store cards in the Hub UI now show "MongoDB" badge for local mode instances and "Atlas" for native Atlas Vector Search instances.
- **Vendor dropdown**: Changed from "MongoDB Atlas" to "MongoDB" in the vendor selector.

### Fixed
- **Agent API response**: `vector_store_instance_id` and `vector_store_mode` fields were missing from the `GET /api/agents/{id}` response.
- **A2A memory search**: Use `get_shared_embedding_service()` singleton instead of creating a new `EmbeddingService()` per call (prevents model reload).
- **MongoDB adapter async safety**: Local cosine search methods now run in `asyncio.to_thread()` to prevent blocking the event loop.
- **MongoDB adapter memory**: Added projection to `_local_cosine_search_with_embeddings` to prevent loading entire documents into memory.
- **Frontend toggle**: Fixed Local Mode toggle treating `undefined` as local mode on first click.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

#### Temporal Memory Decay Frontend (Item 37)

- **Agent Studio decay configuration**: New "Temporal Decay" section in Agent Builder Memory Config with enable toggle, decay rate slider (0.001-1.0), archive threshold slider (0-1.0), and MMR diversity slider (0-1.0). Decay fields persisted via builder save endpoint with float validation and rounding.
- **Memory Inspector freshness badges**: Per-fact colored dots (green=fresh, yellow=fading, orange=stale, gray=archived) with decay factor percentage. Freshness distribution summary bar when decay is enabled.
- **Archive decayed facts**: Dry-run preview with fact count, then confirm to archive. Clears on agent/thread switch to prevent wrong-context operations.

#### Channel Health Tab in Watcher (Item 38)

- **New Watcher tab**: "Channel Health" tab with summary bar (total, healthy, unhealthy, open circuits), instance cards grid with circuit breaker state visualization, and per-instance Probe/Reset actions.
- **Event history**: Expandable per-instance event timeline showing circuit breaker state transitions with timestamps and reasons.
- **Alert configuration**: Collapsible panel with webhook URL, email recipients, cooldown settings, and enable/disable toggle.
- **8 API client methods**: Full frontend integration with all channel health backend endpoints.

#### Test Connection on Provider Instance Create (Item 27b)

- **New backend endpoint**: `POST /api/provider-instances/test-connection` accepts raw credentials (vendor, base_url, api_key) without requiring a saved instance. SSRF validation on base_url, falls back to tenant-level API key.
- **Create mode button**: Test Connection button now visible during instance creation (previously edit-only). Disabled when no API key entered (except Ollama).

#### Inline Screenshots in Playground (Item 35)

- **Multi-image support**: Backend now returns all `media_paths` images (previously only first). New `image_urls` array in response alongside backward-compatible `image_url`.
- **Image grid + lightbox**: Multiple images render in a 2-column grid. Click any image to open full-screen lightbox overlay with close on backdrop click or Escape key.

#### Message Queuing on Circuit Breaker OPEN (Item 38)

- **Router circuit breaker check**: `route_message()` now checks channel circuit breaker state before processing. If the channel's circuit breaker is OPEN, messages are enqueued via `MessageQueueService` instead of being processed immediately. Guarded by `TSN_CB_QUEUE_ENABLED` env var (default: true). Fail-safe: if enqueue fails, falls through to normal processing.

### Changed

- **Docker env passthrough**: Added `GROQ_API_KEY`, `GROK_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` to docker-compose.yml backend environment.

### Fixed

#### Pre-Release Security Audit (2026-04-03)

- **Error detail leaking**: Sanitized 40 `HTTPException(500, detail=str(e))` calls across 10 API route files (`routes_scheduler`, `routes_skills`, `routes_memory`, `routes_custom_skills`, `routes_hub`, `routes_skill_integrations`, `routes_google`, `routes_telegram_instances`, `routes_provider_instances`, `routes_knowledge_base`). All now return generic context-appropriate messages instead of raw Python exception strings. Added missing `logger.error()` calls for 3 Telegram instance routes.
- **Dev/debug scripts in git**: Removed 13 internal development scripts from git tracking (`check_*.py`, `debug_*.py`, `fix_shell_wait.py`, `e2e_test_results.txt`). Added gitignore patterns to prevent re-tracking.
- **Inconsistent tenant isolation**: Standardized `list_runs` endpoint in `routes_flows.py` to use `filter_by_tenant()` instead of manual `tenant_id` check, matching all other flow endpoints.

#### Installer Refactor & Security Hardening (2026-04-03)

- **(BUG-269) XSS token theft via localStorage**: SEC-005 Phase 3 — removed all `localStorage` JWT token storage from the frontend. Auth now relies entirely on the httpOnly `tsushin_session` cookie. Backend WebSocket handlers (playground + watcher) updated to authenticate from cookie without requiring first-message token. Setup wizard and SSO exchange endpoints now set the httpOnly cookie. All auth fetch calls include `credentials: 'include'`.
- **(BUG-270) CORS origin wrong for remote HTTP installs**: Installer set `TSN_CORS_ORIGINS` to `http://localhost:3030` for remote installs, blocking all API calls from the actual IP. Fixed by using the public host for `frontend_url` and CORS origins.
- **(BUG-271) docker-compose v1 ContainerConfig error**: BuildKit images lack the `ContainerConfig` key that docker-compose v1 expects on container recreate. Installer now sets `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0` for both `run_docker_compose()` and `build_additional_images()` when using docker-compose v1.
- **(BUG-272) Setup wizard loses API key if "Add" not clicked**: Users who typed an API key but clicked "Complete Setup" without clicking "Add" lost the key. `handleSubmit` now auto-includes any uncommitted key from the text field.

### Changed

#### Installer Redesign (2026-04-03)

- **Infrastructure-only installer**: Removed all 7 API key prompts and 8 tenant/admin credential prompts from the installer. User/org creation and AI provider configuration are now handled exclusively by the `/setup` UI wizard after install.
- **`--defaults` mode simplified**: No longer generates random passwords or bootstraps users. Just sets up `.env`, Docker containers, and SSL — then directs user to `/setup`.
- **argparse with `--help`**: Added proper CLI flags: `--defaults`, `--http`, `--domain`, `--email`, `--port`, `--frontend-port` with validation and usage examples.
- **Let's Encrypt via Caddy**: SSL is handled by Caddy with built-in ACME support (no certbot needed). `--domain` flag requires `--email` for Let's Encrypt notifications.

#### Async Embeddings Migration (2026-04-02)

- **Event loop blocking**: Migrated all 12 sync `embed_text()` / `embed_batch_chunked()` call sites to async variants (`embed_text_async()`, `embed_batch_chunked_async()`) using `asyncio.to_thread()`. Health checks and WebSocket connections no longer stall during embedding-heavy agent processing.
- **SentenceTransformer singleton consolidation**: Removed 4 services that bypassed the shared `EmbeddingService` singleton and instantiated their own `SentenceTransformer` model (combined_knowledge_service, project_memory_service, playground_document_service, project_service). All embedding calls now route through `get_shared_embedding_service()`.
- **Thread-safe singleton**: Added double-checked locking with `threading.Lock` to `get_shared_embedding_service()` to prevent race conditions from concurrent `asyncio.to_thread()` calls.
- **Dockerfile workers**: Reverted `--workers 2` to `--workers 1` — async embeddings eliminate the need for a second worker, halving model memory usage.

#### Fresh Install QA (2026-04-02)

**Install Flow (3 fixes):**
- **(BUG-248) /setup page**: Created frontend setup wizard at `/setup` for first-run account creation. Login page auto-redirects to `/setup` when database is empty. Added `GET /api/auth/setup-status` endpoint.
- **(BUG-249) --defaults auto-bootstrap**: `python3 install.py --defaults` now creates tenant + admin with random credentials and displays them post-install.
- **(BUG-250) .local email validation**: Patched `email-validator` to allow `.local` TLD for dev environments.

**Installer Security (1 fix):**
- **(BUG-256) HTTPS default**: Self-signed HTTPS is now the default for localhost installs, Let's Encrypt for remote. HTTP requires explicit opt-in with plaintext credential warning. `TSN_CORS_ORIGINS` and `TSN_SSL_MODE` auto-configured in `.env`.

**UI/UX (6 fixes):**
- **(BUG-251) Tenant display name**: Header shows tenant name instead of raw ID slug (`tenant_2026...`).
- **(BUG-252) Markdown rendering**: Playground renders markdown in agent responses (bold, bullets, code blocks) via ReactMarkdown.
- **(BUG-253) Thread titles**: Smarter auto-naming strips greetings and extracts topic instead of truncating first 50 chars.
- **(BUG-254) Console noise**: Expected 401 errors downgraded to `console.debug`, verbose playground logs gated behind `NODE_ENV`.
- **(BUG-255) Tour highlighting**: Onboarding tour now highlights target UI elements with pulsing teal outline.
- **(BUG-257) Tour content**: Updated with current AI providers, channel setup guidance, Sentinel security, and API v1 access.

#### Google SSO Enrollment Fixes (2026-04-01)

- **(BUG-246) Soft delete locks SSO re-enrollment**: Team member removal now uses hard delete instead of soft delete. Soft delete left `google_id` linked to a deactivated record, permanently blocking re-enrollment. SSO lookups now also filter `deleted_at` as defense-in-depth. Comprehensive FK cleanup across 12+ tables on user removal.
- **(BUG-247) Avatar URL exceeds column length**: Google profile avatar URLs can exceed 800 characters. `avatar_url` column changed from `VARCHAR(500)` to `TEXT`. Generic SSO error handler now surfaces actual error detail instead of opaque "Authentication failed".

### Changed

#### Google SSO Auto-Provisioning UI (2026-04-01)

- Auto-provision defaults to **off** (pre-registration required). Users must be added via Team > Invite before signing in with Google SSO.
- Added contextual disclaimer in Settings > Security explaining enrollment behavior for both modes (auto-provision on vs off).
- Updated "How Google Sign-In Works" info section with complete enrollment flow documentation.

#### Critical/High Bug Remediation Sprint (2026-03-31)

**Security (5 fixes):**
- **(SEC-005) httpOnly Cookie Auth — Phase 1 + Phase 2**: Phase 1: Backend sets `tsushin_session` httpOnly cookie on login/signup/invite-accept. `auth_dependencies.py` checks cookie first, Bearer token as fallback. WebSocket accepts cookie auth from upgrade request. Logout endpoint clears cookie. Phase 2: Migrated all 19 frontend files (~84 fetch calls) from manual `localStorage.getItem('tsushin_auth_token')` to centralized `authenticatedFetch()`. Removed all `getAuthHeaders()` helpers. Token only read in 3 intentional locations (AuthContext lifecycle, authenticatedFetch fallback, WebSocket auth).
- **(SEC-010) API Client JWT Revocation on Secret Rotation**: Added `secret_rotated_at` column to `ApiClient`. JWT claim includes rotation timestamp. `_resolve_api_client_jwt` rejects tokens issued before last rotation. DB migration included.
- **(SEC-019) File Upload Magic Bytes Validation**: PDF and DOCX uploads validated via `filetype` library magic bytes check. ZIP bomb protection for DOCX with 100MB uncompressed size limit. Extension-only validation for text formats (txt/csv/json).
- **(LOG-020) Sentinel Configurable Fail Behavior**: Sentinel pre-check exception handling now supports `sentinel_fail_behavior` config field (`"open"` | `"closed"`). Fail-closed blocks message and logs structured error instead of silently allowing.
- **CORS Hardening**: Replaced wildcard `"*"` with origin reflection (`allow_origin_regex=".*"`) for `credentials: true` support. Restricted `allow_methods` and `allow_headers` from `"*"` to explicit lists. Exception handlers updated to match.

**Multi-Tenancy Isolation (6 fixes):**
- **(LOG-002) Cross-Tenant Subflow Execution**: `SubflowStepHandler` validates target flow belongs to same tenant before execution. `run_flow()` accepts optional `tenant_id` filter.
- **(LOG-003) Cross-Tenant Memory Query Leakage**: `_get_thread_messages()` in `conversation_knowledge_service.py` now scopes Memory queries by agent_ids belonging to the caller's tenant.
- **(LOG-004) Cross-Tenant Document Chunk IDOR**: `get_project_knowledge_chunks()` verifies `doc_id` belongs to the verified `project_id` before returning chunks.
- **(LOG-012) ContactAgentMapping Tenant Isolation**: Added `tenant_id` column with DB migration + backfill from agent's tenant. Router contact lookup scoped by MCP instance's tenant.
- **(LOG-014) Cross-Tenant Agent-to-Project Assignment**: `update_project_agents()` validates each `agent_id` belongs to the caller's tenant before creating `AgentProjectAccess` records.
- **(LOG-018) Anonymous Contact Hash Fallback**: Replaced `hash(sender) % 1000000` phantom ID fallback with re-raise. Callers use sender-string-based memory key.

**Flow Engine (3 fixes):**
- **(LOG-007) Stale Flow Run Recovery**: `run_flow()` resets "running" flows older than 1 hour to "failed" on startup. `on_failure=continue` with failed steps now reports `"completed_with_errors"` instead of `"completed"`.
- **(LOG-010) Step Idempotency TOCTOU**: SELECT FOR UPDATE with `skip_locked=True` + IntegrityError handling prevents concurrent step execution race.
- **(LOG-011) Flow Cancellation**: `db.refresh(flow_run)` between steps detects external cancellation and breaks the execution loop.

**Logic (2 fixes):**
- **(LOG-006) A2A Depth Limit Enforcement**: `SkillManager.execute_tool_call()` propagates `comm_depth` and `comm_parent_session_id` from message metadata into skill config for chained delegation depth tracking.
- **Already fixed (validated):** SEC-001 (admin password reset JWT invalidation), SEC-008 (update_client privilege escalation check), SEC-016 (shell queue_command tenant policies).

Hierarchical resolution: tenant default → per-contact override. 3-state dropdown UI in Contacts page. Applies across all channels.
- **Agent-to-Agent Communication**: Agents within the same tenant can communicate directly. 3 actions: `ask` (sync Q&A), `list_agents` (discover capabilities), `delegate` (full handoff with context). Permission management (per-pair grants), rate limiting (per-pair + global), loop detection (parent_session_id chain), depth limiting (default 3). Sentinel `agent_escalation` detection type. "Communication" tab in Agent Studio with session log, permissions CRUD, statistics dashboard.
- **Billing Structure Audit & Cost Tracking**: Token tracking propagated to all 13 previously-missing AIClient call sites across skills and services (FlowsSkill, SchedulerSkill, SearchSkill, BrowserAutomationSkill, FlightSearchSkill, SchedulerService, FactExtractor, ConversationKnowledgeService, AISummaryService, SentinelService). OpenAI streaming uses `stream_options={"include_usage": True}` for actual token counts. Gemini streaming captures `usage_metadata`. Fixed Gemini token estimation.
- **Permission Matrix Update**: All 170+ endpoints audited. Scheduler permissions seeded (entire scheduler was returning 403). Frontend `billing.manage` → `billing.write` mismatch fixed. Sentinel profile read endpoints secured. Knowledge base RBAC guards added. Slack/Discord integration permissions seeded.

#### Memory
- **Temporal Memory Decay with MMR Reranking**: Exponential decay (`e^(-λ × days)`) applied at retrieval time — older memories receive lower relevance scores. MMR reranking for result diversity. Auto-archive facts below configurable threshold. Freshness labels: fresh/fading/stale/archived. Applied to Layer 2 (Episodic/ChromaDB), Layer 3 (Semantic Knowledge), and Layer 4 (Shared Pool). `memory_decay_enabled`, `memory_decay_lambda`, `memory_decay_archive_threshold`, `memory_decay_mmr_lambda` fields on Agent. `last_accessed_at` tracking on SemanticKnowledge and SharedMemory.

#### Image Generation
- **Image generation for Playground channel**: Generated images from the `generate_image` tool are rendered inline in Playground chat messages. Images can be clicked to open in a new tab.
- **Image generation for Telegram channel**: Generated images sent as photos via the Telegram Bot API with optional captions.
- **Image serving endpoint**: New `GET /api/playground/images/{image_id}` endpoint serves generated images to the Playground frontend.
- **WebSocket image delivery**: Image URLs propagated through the WebSocket streaming pipeline for real-time image display.

#### Other
- `ROADMAP.md` for tracking planned features and releases.
- `CHANGELOG.md` for documenting changes across releases.

### Changed
- **Legacy keyword triggering deprecated**: All hybrid skills are now tool-only execution mode. Web scraping skill deprecated and replaced by browser_automation skill.
- **Weather skill removed**: Deprecated and fully removed from backend, frontend, Hub, and README.
- **iOS-style toggle switches**: All enable/disable toggles across the entire platform unified to a consistent iOS-style `ToggleSwitch` component.
- **Agent list performance**: N+1 API calls reduced from 92 requests (~2 per agent for skills) to ~6 requests for a 46-agent list. Agent cards now use `skills_count` from the list response.
- **Sandboxed Tools config moved to Skills modal**: Dedicated Sandboxed Tools tab removed; config integrated into the Skills modal for a cleaner UI.
- **Skills UI overhaul**: Separate sections for built-in and custom skills, emoji icons removed, "Add Skill" pattern added.
- **Design system migration**: Auth pages and Agent Detail page migrated to Tsushin design system tokens. Login page updated with Tsushin kitsune banner.
- **Watcher Threats by Type**: Compacted from separate cards to inline pill badges for a denser, more scannable layout.
- **Sentinel default profile**: System default changed from Moderate (block) to Permissive (detect_only) to reduce false positives on fresh installs.
- **ImageSkill default config**: `enabled_channels` now includes `"telegram"` in addition to `"whatsapp"` and `"playground"`.
- **TelegramSender**: Added `send_photo()` method for sending images via the Telegram Bot API.
- **PlaygroundService**: Skill results and agent service results now propagate `media_paths` as cached `image_url` values in both regular and streaming response paths.
- **PlaygroundWebSocketService**: `done` events now include `image_url` field when images are generated.
- **PlaygroundChatResponse**: Added `image_url` field to the API response model.
- **PlaygroundMessage**: Added `image_url` field to the message model (both backend and frontend).
- **ExpertMode component**: Message bubbles now render generated images with responsive sizing and click-to-open behavior.

- **(BUG-149) Agent-level sandboxed tool authorization bypass**: Added `AgentSandboxedTool` authorization check before execution.

#### RBAC Permission Matrix Audit (BUG-150 to BUG-153)
- **(BUG-150) Scheduler permissions not seeded — entire scheduler API returns 403**: Added 4 scheduler permissions to `seed_rbac_defaults` with proper role assignments.
- **(BUG-151) Billing page inaccessible — billing.manage vs billing.write mismatch**: Frontend permission check corrected to `billing.write`.
- **(BUG-152) Sentinel profile read endpoints missing RBAC**: Added `org.settings.read` guard to 5 read endpoints.

#### v0.6.0 Perfection Team Audit — 45 Bugs (BUG-156 to BUG-200)

**Critical (11):**
- **(BUG-156) Custom skill script_entrypoint shell injection**: Added regex validation on save; `shlex.quote()` at execution.
- **(BUG-157) TSUSHIN_INPUT env var unquoted shell injection**: Applied `shlex.quote()` around the JSON string.
- **(BUG-158) stdio_binary allowlist bypass via PUT update endpoint**: Added same allowlist + path traversal + metacharacter checks from POST to PUT endpoint.

- **(BUG-178) WhatsApp adapter blocking httpx.get() in async send_message**: Replaced with `httpx.AsyncClient` with `await`.
- **(BUG-179) Agent comm skill always passes depth=0 — depth limit ineffective**: Fixed `depth` and `parent_session_id` forwarding from calling context.
- **(BUG-180) API v1 sender_key computed but never passed to service**: Passed `sender_key` to `send_message()` and `process_message_streaming()`.

#### Other Fixes
- **Flow step cursor position loss and pending edits lost on save**: `CursorSafeInput`/`CursorSafeTextarea` components created with local state that only syncs from parent when not focused. Flush-on-unmount added so pending edits are not lost when modal closes.
- **Flow step Notification field mapping mismatch**: Fixed `content` vs `message_template` field read/write inconsistency.
- **Flow step backend schema missing fields**: `FlowStepConfig` Pydantic model now includes all fields for skill, summarization, and slash_command step types.
- **[object Object] error toast in Studio**: `handleApiError` now properly extracts Pydantic validation error arrays. All ~200 API methods in `client.ts` now use `handleApiError` for consistent error display.
- **Contact form "external" role 422 error**: Contact form now supports the `external` role.
- **Agent Studio builder save**: Persona and channel changes now persist correctly on builder save.
- **Playground NoneType len() error**: Resolved and improved error handling.
- **Google credential save crash**: Preserved `tenant_id` for admins to fix credential encryption failures.
- **Browser skill session manager wiring**: Session manager properly wired, structured errors fixed, value leak resolved.

#### VM Fresh Install Regression
- **RBAC seeding crash loop on first boot**: Added orphan-permissions guard at the start of `seed_rbac_defaults` — if permissions exist but no roles exist, permissions are cleared before re-seeding. Prevents `UniqueViolation` crash-restart loop on the first backend startup.
- **Global admin login returns 500 — NULL tenant_id in audit logging**: Added early-return guard in `log_tenant_event()` when `tenant_id is None`. Global admins have no tenant affiliation; their actions are handled by `GlobalAdminAuditService` separately.
- **(BUG-201) Installer leaves frontend unhealthy — docker-compose v1 health dependency race**: Installer now waits for backend to become healthy before starting the frontend container, working around docker-compose v1.29.2 `service_healthy` condition race on Ubuntu 24.04.
- **(BUG-202) Browser API calls use relative paths incompatible with HTTP-only installs**: Fixed `client.ts` API URL resolution so installations without Caddy proxy (SSL disabled) work correctly. Relative `/api/*` paths now resolve against the correct origin.
