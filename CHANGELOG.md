## [0.6.0] - Unreleased

**Theme:** Security, Streaming, Providers, Public API & UX

### Added

#### Sentinel Security Profiles
- Granular security profiles with custom configuration per protection rule
- Profile assignment at tenant, agent, or skill level with hierarchical inheritance
- Profile management UI: create, edit, clone, delete (Settings > Sentinel > Profiles)
- Security graph view with agent/skill hierarchy visualization
- Effective config preview per scope level

#### MemGuard (Memory Poisoning Detection)
- 5th Sentinel detection type: `memory_poisoning` with `applies_to: ["memory"]`
- Layer A: Pre-storage regex pattern matching (EN + PT) blocks poisoned messages before memory write
- Layer B: Fact validation gate blocks credential injection, command patterns, and contradictions
- Integrated with Security Profiles via zero-migration design (detection_overrides inheritance)
- Dedicated MemGuard tab with branded UI in Settings > Sentinel
- 45 unit tests + 103 integration tests

#### Message Queuing System
- Async message queue for all channels (Playground, WhatsApp, Telegram)
- `MessageQueue` table with Alembic migration 0003
- `MessageQueueService` with `SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` for concurrent processing
- `QueueWorker` asyncio background processor with dead-letter after 3 retries
- Queue API routes and frontend WebSocket queue events
- Playground async/sync modes (`?sync=true`)

#### WebSocket Streaming
- Token-by-token response streaming via `/ws/playground` WebSocket endpoint
- Secure first-message authentication (token in first message, not URL params)
- `PlaygroundWebSocketService` with streaming chunk types: token, thinking, done, error
- `PlaygroundWebSocket` frontend client with auto-reconnect and exponential backoff
- `usePlaygroundWebSocket` React hook for streaming state management
- `StreamingMessage` component with animated typing indicators

#### Public API v1
- Programmatic REST API for external applications to interact with Tsushin agents

- Agent Chat: `POST /api/v1/agents/{id}/chat` (sync + async modes)
- Thread Management: list, get, delete conversation threads
- Resource Listing: skills, tools, personas, security-profiles, tone-presets
- Profile Assignment: assign skills, personas, security profiles to agents
- Client Management UI: Settings > API Clients (create, rotate, revoke)
- Rate Limiting: per-client RPM with `X-RateLimit-*` headers
- Request Audit: `X-Request-Id` + `api_request_log` table
- 5 API roles: `api_agent_only`, `api_readonly`, `api_member`, `api_admin`, `api_owner`

- Keyboard Delete key support with memory node guard
- Warning toast when removing last channel
- Automatic layout reflow after removal, group node auto-collapse when empty

#### Active Chain Edge Glow (Graph View)
- Edge glow color matched to target node type: cyan (channel->agent), blue (agent chain), teal (skill), violet (KB)
- Pulse animation synchronized with node glow (1.5s cycle)
- Coordinated fade-out with 3s post-processing fade
- SVG `filter: drop-shadow()` for glow effect on edge paths

#### SSL/HTTPS Encryption
- Caddy reverse proxy with 3 SSL modes: Let's Encrypt, manual certs, self-signed (`tls internal`)
