## [0.6.0] - Unreleased

**Theme:** Security, Streaming, Providers, Public API & UX

### Removed

#### Weather Skill Deprecation
- Removed Weather skill (OpenWeatherMap integration) from the platform
- Removed `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` from all environment configuration files
- Cleaned up weather references from backend, frontend, tests, and documentation
- Auto-cleanup of weather skill records and slash commands on startup
- Updated skill count from 21 to 20

### Changed

#### Skills UI Overhaul — "Add Skill" Pattern
- Redesigned Studio > Skills tab to only show enabled/configured skills (instead of listing all available skills)
- Added "Add Skill" button with categorized modal (Communication, Search & Web, Audio & Media, Automation & Tools, Intelligence, Travel)
- Skills are now added as enabled with config modal opening immediately on add
- Each skill card now has a "Remove" action to disable and return to the available pool
- Custom skills integrated into the same Add Skill modal alongside built-in skills
- Search and category filtering in the Add Skill modal
- Consistent card styling with teal gradient theme for all active skills
- Decomposed skill constants into `frontend/components/skills/skill-constants.ts`
- Created reusable `AddSkillModal` component at `frontend/components/skills/AddSkillModal.tsx`

### Security

#### Slash Command Security Hardening
- **CRITICAL:** Fixed shell RBAC bypass via WhatsApp/Telegram channels — `/shell` permission check was skipped when `user_id=None` (non-playground channels). Now denies execution without authenticated user.
- **HIGH:** Fixed cross-tenant thread manipulation — `/thread end`, `/thread list`, `/thread status` queries now filter by `tenant_id` to prevent tenant A from accessing tenant B's threads.
- **HIGH:** Added agent ownership validation on `/api/commands/execute` — `agent_id` parameter is now verified against the authenticated user's tenant.
- **MEDIUM:** Escaped LIKE wildcards in sandboxed tool lookup — prevents `/tool %` from matching all tools in the tenant.
- **MEDIUM:** Added `shlex.quote()` to sandboxed tool command template rendering — prevents shell metacharacter injection via tool parameters.

### Added

#### Slash Command Webhook Handler
- Implemented the webhook handler for custom slash commands (`handler_type: "webhook"`)
- Async HTTP calls with configurable method, headers, timeout (max 30s), and HMAC-SHA256 signing
- SSRF protection: blocks private/internal IP ranges and localhost
- Response body capped at 64KB

#### Slash Command Help Text in UI
- Inline autocomplete (/) now shows `help_text` for the selected command
- Command palette (Cmd+K) now shows `help_text` for the selected command
- Displayed in a compact monospace format below the command description

### Fixed

#### Playground Markdown Rendering
- AI/system message content in ExpertMode now renders with ReactMarkdown + GFM support
- Previously, slash command responses with markdown (`**bold**`, lists, code blocks) were displayed as raw text
- User messages remain as plain text to avoid unintended formatting

### Added

#### Sentinel Security Profiles
- Granular security profiles with custom configuration per protection rule
- Profile assignment at tenant, agent, or skill level with hierarchical inheritance
- Profile management UI: create, edit, clone, delete (Settings > Sentinel > Profiles)
- Security graph view with agent/skill hierarchy visualization
- Effective config preview per scope level

#### MemGuard (Memory Poisoning Detection)
- 5th Sentinel detection type: `memory_poisoning` with `applies_to: ["memory"]`
- Layer A: Pre-storage regex pattern matching (EN + PT) blocks poisoned messages before memory write
- Layer B: Fact validation gate blocks credential injection, command patterns, and contradictions
- Integrated with Security Profiles via zero-migration design (detection_overrides inheritance)
- Dedicated MemGuard tab with branded UI in Settings > Sentinel
- 45 unit tests + 103 integration tests

#### Message Queuing System
- Async message queue for all channels (Playground, WhatsApp, Telegram)

### Fixed

#### Security (v0.6.1 Audit — 21 bugs resolved)

##### SSRF & Input Validation
- BUG-065: Added SSRF validation for `ollama_base_url` with DNS-resolution-based IP checking via new shared `ssrf_validator.py` module
- BUG-066: Replaced string-prefix SSRF checks in scraper, Playwright, and MCP browser providers with post-DNS-resolution validation — fixes DNS rebinding, incorrect 172.x range, and missing IPv6/metadata checks
- BUG-063: Added package name regex validation and `shlex.quote` to toolbox `install_package` — prevents shell command injection
- BUG-064: Changed workspace directory permissions from `0o777` to `0o750` with proper `chown`
- BUG-068: Expanded Sentinel SSRF detection from 2 tools/5 patterns to 12 tools/34 patterns with defense-in-depth URL argument checking

##### Authentication & Authorization
- BUG-072: Added `deleted_at` filter to login and `get_user_by_id` queries — soft-deleted users can no longer authenticate
- BUG-073: Added null-guard for `password_hash` before `verify_password` — SSO users no longer cause 500 on password login
- BUG-076: Added `is_active` check to `auth_routes.get_current_user` — disabled accounts blocked from `/me` and `/logout`
- BUG-071: Password reset and invitation tokens now stored as SHA-256 hashes instead of plaintext
- BUG-070: API client creation validates that requested scopes are a subset of creator's permissions — prevents privilege escalation
- BUG-074: Replaced wildcard `ProxyHeadersMiddleware(trusted_hosts=["*"])` with configurable `TSN_TRUSTED_PROXY_HOSTS` (default `127.0.0.1,::1`)

##### Multi-Tenancy Isolation
- BUG-069: Scoped default agent create/update/delete operations to caller's tenant — prevents cross-tenant data corruption
- BUG-082: Removed `Agent.tenant_id.is_(None)` from analytics queries — tenants no longer see NULL-tenant agents
- BUG-083: Rewrote `conversation_search_service` to join through Agent table — fixes non-existent `Memory.tenant_id` column reference
- BUG-067: Restricted global-scoped URL config fields to global admin only (interim fix for Config singleton)

##### RBAC Permission Gates
- BUG-075: Added `require_permission("org.settings.read")` to Sentinel GET /config/agent/{id}, GET /logs, GET /stats
- BUG-077: Added `shell.read` permission gate to Hub Shell page
- BUG-078: Added `tools.read` permission gate to Hub Sandboxed Tools page
- BUG-079: Added `org.settings.read` permission gates to 5 settings pages (Sentinel, Security, AI Configuration, Model Pricing, Integrations)

##### Data Integrity
- BUG-080: Hard user delete now clears FK references (UserInvitation, GlobalAdminAuditLog, PasswordResetToken) before deletion
- BUG-081: Fixed inverted tenant_id logic in SSO config endpoints — uses `tenant_context.tenant_id` consistently

##### Previous Security Fixes
- Reduced Sentinel false positives for educational shell queries and language preferences
- MemGuard false positive reduction: long token regex 20->32, negative lookahead for common words
- Fixed `warn_only` mode handling in MemGuard
- Fixed `detect_only` and `warn_only` modes in Sentinel cache, notifications, and safety nets
- Changed system default Sentinel profile from Moderate (block) to Permissive (detect_only)
- Fixed stale `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` defaults to `2.5-flash-lite`
- Removed hardcoded dev password from `alembic.ini`
- Removed tracked dev artifacts and hardened `.gitignore`
- Fixed Helm chart missing `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in secrets — pod would fail `InvalidPodSpec` on GKE
- Fixed `TSN_GCP_PROJECT_ID` not injected into pod — backend would crash with `KeyError` at startup
- Fixed `commit_container` hard error in K8s mode — now gracefully falls back to DB-only package tracking
- Fixed hardcoded `v0.6.0` image tag in CI — now derived from `Chart.yaml appVersion`
- Shell injection prevention in `K8sRuntime` exec commands via `shlex.quote`
- Thread-safe exec exit code cache with `Lock` in `K8sRuntime`
- PVC cleanup on container removal in `K8sRuntime` to prevent resource leaks
- GCP warm-up no longer caches `None` values on failure (forces retry on next access)

#### UI & UX

- Fixed Channels tab not persisting toggles: changed to auto-save on toggle (consistent with Skills tab behavior)

#### Agent Studio
- Fixed builder edge routing and child node drag behavior
- Fixed node drag and interaction blocking issues
- Made group nodes selectable for hover and click
- Persisted persona and channel changes in builder save
- Replaced dagre with manual tree layout for proper TB hierarchy
- Replaced smoothstep curves with straight edges
- Fixed builder validation, logging, and tenant isolation

#### Sentinel
- Fixed `skill_context` in router and false positives with `detection_mode`
- Fixed `threat_reason` field usage (was referencing non-existent `response_message`)
- Showed all skill nodes in security graph with expand/collapse
- Hidden inactive agents in security graph by default
- Removed duplicated sentinel settings from MemGuard tab

#### Billing & Cost Tracking (BUG-110, BUG-111)
- BUG-110: Fixed 13 AIClient call sites silently dropping `token_tracker` — skill classification, flow intent parsing, scheduler operations, fact extraction, search/browser/flight parsing, sentinel analysis, and persona summaries now properly tracked in TokenUsage table
- BUG-111: Fixed Gemini token estimation using `len(text)//4` — now reads actual `response.usage_metadata` (prompt_token_count, candidates_token_count) when available
- Added `set_token_tracker()` to BaseSkill with automatic propagation via SkillManager to all skills
- Added debug-level guardrail log in AIClient when instantiated without `token_tracker` for future gap detection
- SchedulerService background worker now creates TokenTracker for cost tracking of unattended scheduled conversations
- MultiAgentMemoryManager and FactExtractor now receive and propagate token_tracker through the full memory pipeline

#### Platform Hardening (BUG-105 to BUG-108)
- BUG-105: Fixed flow SummarizationStepHandler nested dict lookup — `input_data.get("step_1.thread_id")` changed to proper `input_data.get("step_1", {}).get("thread_id")`. Template `{{step_2.summary}}` now resolves correctly.
- BUG-106: Fixed playground "Failed to Load Conversation" — threads with sender_key format mismatches now return empty messages with warning instead of error
- BUG-107: Fixed MCP servers always showing "disconnected" — added auto-connect background task on startup

- Fixed installer port configuration to actually take effect
- Fixed Alembic migrations 0003/0004 DuplicateTable on fresh PostgreSQL installs (idempotent table creation)
- Fixed Hub provider cards for Groq/Grok/ElevenLabs showing "Coming Soon" instead of "Available"

### Changed

- Bumped version to v0.6.0
- `ToolboxContainerService` refactored to use `ContainerRuntime` interface
- `MCPContainerManager` refactored to use `ContainerRuntime` interface
- `settings.py` now routes secret retrieval through `SecretProvider`
- `auth_utils.py` `JWT_SECRET_KEY` now uses `SecretProvider` instead of direct `os.getenv()`
- GKE deploy workflow changed to manual-only trigger until GCP infrastructure is configured
- `tsushin-network` is now an external Docker network — survives `docker-compose down` to preserve MCP/WhatsApp sessions. Existing installs must run `docker network create tsushin-network` or re-run `install.py`.
- Pre-commit YAML check now excludes Helm template directory
- Compacted Watcher "Threats by Type" into inline pill badges
- Added `frontend/lib/` to repo (was excluded by Python gitignore pattern)
