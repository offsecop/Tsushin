# Deployment Test Playbook (Fresh Install)

> Manual QA checklist to validate a fresh Tsushin deployment.
> Run through each section sequentially after a clean install.
> Uses `<tenant_admin_email>` / `<global_admin_email>` placeholders — substitute with the credentials created or revealed during `/setup`.

---

## Prerequisites

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Tenant admin account | Created in the `/setup` wizard (`<tenant_admin_email>` / `<tenant_admin_password>`) |
| Global admin account | Auto-generated and revealed on the final `/setup` completion screen (`<global_admin_email>` / `<global_admin_password>`) |
| At least one default agent | Seeded automatically by installer |
| Browser | Modern Chromium-based browser |
| VM/server IP | `10.211.55.5` (adjust if different) |
| LLM keys | Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic for provider coverage; Brave for search coverage |
| Local model runtime | Optional but recommended: Ollama reachable from the backend container |

## Audit Profile — Ubuntu VM (`develop` HEAD)

Use this profile when reproducing the 2026-04-08 interactive Ubuntu VM audit:

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Git branch | `develop` |
| Installer mode | Real interactive installer (`python3 install.py`) |
| Backend port | `8081` |
| Frontend port | `3030` |
| Access type | `remote` |
| Public host/IP | `10.211.55.5` |
| SSL mode | HTTP only |
| Setup org name | `Tsushin QA` |
| Setup admin | `test@example.com` / `test123` |
| Default agents | `create_default_agents=true` |
| Evidence folder | `output/playwright/` |

> Note: the historical 2026-04-08 audit used `test123`, but repeat runs should use an 8+ character admin password such as `test12345` until `BUG-457` is fixed. The setup wizard currently accepts shorter passwords than later auth flows.

---

## Known Issues & Workarounds

| Bug | Status | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| BUG-201: docker-compose v1 frontend race | **Fixed in current release** — `install.py` now auto-recovers frontend after backend health. If on an older install, workaround: `docker-compose up -d frontend` once backend is healthy. |
| BUG-202: Relative API paths 404 in HTTP-only installs | **Fixed in current release** — `client.ts` now uses absolute `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` for all API calls. |
| BUG-454: backend no-cache rebuild depends on external model prewarm | **Open** — if `docker compose up -d --build --no-cache backend` fails during Hugging Face model download, capture the logs as evidence and continue with the last healthy image or a targeted `docker compose up -d --no-build backend`. Do not `docker compose down` as part of the recovery path. |
| BUG-457: setup password validation is weaker than later auth flows | **Open** — use an 8+ character tenant admin password for repeatable QA, even if the setup form currently accepts shorter values. |

---

## TC-0: Setup Wizard + Credential Reveal

**Goal:** Confirm a fresh install reaches `/setup`, creates the tenant, and reveals the auto-generated global admin credentials.

### Steps

1. Open `http://<host>:3030/setup`.
2. Complete the wizard with:
   - **Organization:** `Tsushin QA`
   - **Tenant admin email:** `<tenant_admin_email>`
   - **Tenant admin password:** `<tenant_admin_password>`
   - **Create default agents:** enabled
   - **Primary provider:** Gemini
3. Also enter OpenAI and Anthropic keys during setup so the tenant starts with multiple LLM providers available.
4. Finish setup and capture the generated global admin credentials shown on the completion screen.
5. Save a screenshot of the completion state to `output/playwright/`.

### Pass Criteria

| # | Check | Pass? |
|---|-------|-------|
| 1 | `/setup` loads and submits without error | |
| 2 | Tenant admin account is created successfully | |
| 3 | Completion screen reveals global admin credentials | |
| 4 | Redirect to login or dashboard succeeds after setup | |

---

## TC-1: Infrastructure Health

**Goal:** Confirm all services are up and responding before UI testing.

### Steps

1. From any machine with network access, run:
   ```bash
   curl -s http://<host>:8081/api/health      # expect: {"status": "healthy"}
   curl -s http://<host>:8081/api/readiness   # expect: {"status": "ready"}
   curl -s http://<host>:8081/metrics | head  # expect: Prometheus metrics output
   ```
2. Open `http://<host>:3030` in the browser — the Tsushin login page should load.

### Pass Criteria

| # | Check | Pass? |
|---|-------|-------|
| 1 | `/api/health` returns `{"status": "healthy"}` (HTTP 200) | |
| 2 | `/api/readiness` returns `{"status": "ready"}` (HTTP 200) | |
| 3 | `/metrics` returns Prometheus-formatted text | |
| 4 | Frontend login page loads at port 3030 | |

---

## TC-1A: Auth Throttle Sanity

**Goal:** Confirm QA installs do not get blocked by auth throttling during repetitive browser/API validation.

### Steps

1. From the repository root on the target host, verify the backend container received the runtime auth settings:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec backend /bin/sh -lc 'printf "TSN_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT=%s\nTSN_DISABLE_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT=%s\n" "$TSN_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT" "$TSN_DISABLE_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT"'
   ```
2. If QA is using the explicit override path, set `TSN_DISABLE_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT=true` in `.env` before recreating the backend container.
3. Perform a rapid login burst against `POST /api/auth/login` using the tenant admin credentials:
   ```bash
   for i in $(seq 1 12); do
     curl -s -o /tmp/tsn-login-$i.json -w "%{http_code}\n" \
       -X POST http://<host>:8081/api/auth/login \
       -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
       -d '{"email":"<tenant_admin_email>","password":"<tenant_admin_password>"}'
   done
   ```
4. If the install is intentionally using a high but finite `TSN_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT`, keep the burst under that configured threshold and confirm no unexpected `429` appears.
5. Log any `429 Too Many Requests` response as a release regression rather than pausing the rest of the audit.

### Pass Criteria

| # | Check | Pass? |
|---|-------|-------|
| 1 | Backend container exposes the expected `TSN_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT` / `TSN_DISABLE_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT` values | |
| 2 | QA override installs complete a 10-12 login burst without `429` responses | |
| 3 | Any throttling seen matches the explicit configured limit rather than an undeclared hardcoded default | |

4. Execute one sandboxed tool against a safe public target such as `example.com` or `scanme.nmap.org`.
5. In Playground, run `/shell`, `/tools`, `/status`, `/memory status`, and `/inject`.

### Pass Criteria

| # | Check | Pass? |
|---|-------|-------|
| 1 | Beacon registers and checks in successfully | |
| 2 | Approved shell command completes and returns output | |
| 3 | Sandboxed tool executes successfully | |
| 4 | Slash-command routing works for all covered commands | |
| 5 | Beacon bootstrap does not require undocumented manual recovery beyond the VM's native Python `venv` package | |

## TC-28: Public API v1 + Generated Client

**Goal:** Validate API v1 auth modes, sync/async chat, thread access, and one generated client call against the live VM.

### Steps

1. Create API client credentials in `/settings/api-clients`.
2. Use direct API-key auth to call:
   - `GET /api/v1/agents`
   - `GET /api/v1/skills`
   - `GET /api/v1/tools`
3. Use OAuth client-credentials auth to request a bearer token and call `GET /api/v1/flows`.
4. Send one sync chat request and one async chat request, then poll the queue until completion.
5. Fetch the corresponding thread and message history by listing threads with `GET /api/v1/agents/{agent_id}/threads`, then calling `GET /api/v1/agents/{agent_id}/threads/{thread_id}/messages` for the returned thread ID.
6. Download `/openapi.json`, generate a client from the local file, and perform at least one live API call with the generated SDK.

### Pass Criteria

| # | Check | Pass? |
|---|-------|-------|
| 1 | Direct API-key auth succeeds | |
| 2 | OAuth client-credentials auth succeeds | |
| 3 | Sync and async chat both complete successfully | |
| 4 | Thread and message retrieval work for completed chats | |
| 5 | Generated client completes at least one live call | |

## TC-29: Flows — Programmatic + Agentic Nodes

**Goal:** Confirm both API-created and UI-executed flows work for the current release scope.

### Steps

1. Create one simple programmatic flow via the API or UI.
2. Create one flow that includes an agentic node or skill/tool-based node.
3. If a flow depends on trigger data, execute it from the UI and confirm the UI collects or sends the required trigger context.
4. Execute both flows from the UI when possible.
5. Review recent runs on `/flows` and confirm completed vs failed states, logs, and outputs.
6. If using search or notification steps, verify the configured provider/recipient resolution works in the tenant scope.

### Pass Criteria

| # | Check | Pass? |
|---|-------|-------|
| 1 | Programmatic flow can be created and executed | |
| 2 | Agentic flow can be created and executed | |
| 3 | Input-dependent flows can be launched from the UI with valid trigger context | |
| 4 | Run history reflects the true result state | |
| 5 | Step outputs or errors are inspectable for debugging | |

## TC-30: Projects + Knowledge Base Stability

**Goal:** Validate project-scoped chat, project knowledge uploads, and direct project-to-agent behavior.

### Steps

1. Create a project bound to a specific agent.
2. Start a direct project conversation and confirm the agent responds using that project context.
3. In that same project conversation, store a project-only fact and immediately ask a follow-up question that should recall it.
4. Verify project memory counters or facts endpoints increase after the stored fact.
5. Upload a small project knowledge file.
6. Confirm the upload completes without restarting the backend.
7. Ask the project a question that should use the uploaded knowledge.

### Pass Criteria

| # | Check | Pass? |
|---|-------|-------|
| 1 | Project creation succeeds | |
| 2 | Direct project chat routes to the intended agent | |
| 3 | Project-scoped facts can be recalled inside the same direct project conversation | |
| 4 | Project memory stats/facts increase after storing a project fact | |
| 5 | Project knowledge upload completes successfully | |
| 6 | Backend remains healthy after upload | |
| 7 | Project chat can use uploaded knowledge | |

## TC-31: A2A Monitoring + Graph View

**Goal:** Confirm agent-to-agent traffic is visible in both the dedicated communications view and the graph visualization.

### Steps

1. Trigger an A2A conversation such as Tsushin delegating to ACME Sales.
2. Open `/agents/communication` and confirm a completed session is listed with source, target, depth, and status.
3. Open Graph View and verify the interaction appears visually.
4. Treat a graph edge alone as insufficient evidence. If the graph shows an A2A edge but the communication log is empty, fail the case and record the mismatch explicitly.
5. Save screenshots for both views to `output/playwright/`.

### Pass Criteria

| # | Check | Pass? |
|---|-------|-------|
| 1 | Communication session appears in `/agents/communication` | |
| 2 | Session status and depth are correct | |
| 3 | Graph View reflects the A2A interaction | |
| 4 | Evidence screenshots are captured | |
