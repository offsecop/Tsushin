### Branch Naming

- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring

### Commit Messages

Use clear and descriptive commit messages:

```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation if needed.
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Examples:
- `feat(memory): add cross-agent fact sharing`
- `fix(flows): resolve step execution timeout`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python (Backend)

- Follow PEP 8 conventions
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for public functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized

### TypeScript/React (Frontend)

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing component patterns
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused on single responsibilities

### General

- Write self-documenting code with clear variable/function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep files reasonably sized
- Remove unused code and imports

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend development)

### Running Tests

```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
pytest tests/

# Frontend (if applicable)
cd frontend
npm test
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Install pre-commit hooks to prevent secrets from being committed:

```bash
./scripts/setup-hooks.sh
```

## Architecture Overview

Tsushin follows a multi-tenant architecture with these main components:

- **Backend (FastAPI)**: API server, agent runtime, memory system
- **Frontend (Next.js)**: Web UI for management and playground
- **Database (PostgreSQL 16 + ChromaDB vectors)**: Per-tenant data storage
- **Docker**: Container orchestration for all services

> `docker compose up -d` spins up PostgreSQL, the backend, and the frontend automatically.

See the main README for detailed architecture diagrams.

## Areas for Contribution

- **New Skills**: Extend agent capabilities with new skills
- **Integrations**: Add support for more external services
- **Documentation**: Improve guides and API documentation
- **Testing**: Expand test coverage
- **Bug Fixes**: Help resolve reported issues
- **Performance**: Optimize memory usage and response times
